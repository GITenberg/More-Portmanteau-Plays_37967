<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>During the period which has elapsed between the publication of <i>Portmanteau
Plays</i>, and that of the present volume our country entered upon the
greatest war in history, and emerged victorious. It is far too early to
estimate what effect that war has had or may have upon all art in general,
and upon the dramatic and theatric arts in particular, but there is every
indication that the curtain is about to rise on the great romantic revival
which we have watched and waited for, and of which Stuart Walker has been
one of the major prophets.</p>

<p>During the actual period of the war many of the creative and interpretative
artists of the theater were engaged either directly in army work or in one
of its auxiliary branches. It is amusing to recall that the present writer
met Schuyler Ladd serving as Mess Sergeant for a Base Hospital in France,
Alexander Wollcott, late dramatic critic of the New York <i>Times</i>, attached
to the <i>Stars and Stripes</i> in Paris, and Douglas Stuart, the London
producer, in an English hospital at Etretat, the while he himself was
serving as an enlisted man on the staff of the same hospital. These are
minor instances, but when they have been multiplied several hundred times
one begins to see how closely the actor, the critic, and the producer were
involved in the struggle. Again the problem of providing proper
entertainment for the troops was, and still is, a serious one. In the great
number of cases it seems highly probable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> that the entertainment along such
lines done by the men themselves was far more effective than that provided
by outside organizations. More than once, however, it appeared to the
writer that here was a field especially suited to the <i>Portmanteau Theater</i>
and to its repertory. The question of transportation, always a crucial
point with such a venture, was no more difficult than that presented by
many companies already in the field, and doing immensely inferior work. My
return to America put me in possession of the facts of the matter, and
without desiring in any way to cast blame, much less to indict, or to
emphasize unduly a relatively unimportant point, it seems only fitting that
there should be included in this record the reasons for what has seemed to
many of us a lost opportunity. They are at least much more brief than the
apologia which precedes them.</p>

<p>The <i>Portmanteau Theater</i>, its repertory of forty-eight plays, and its
trained company, was offered for war purposes under the following
conditions: no royalty was to be paid for any of the plays, no salary was
to be paid Mr. Walker; the company was to go wherever sent, whether in or
out of shell fire, in France or in England; the only stipulation being that
the members of the company should be remunerated at the same rate paid an
enlisted man in the United States army, and that the principal members
should receive the pay of subalterns. On the whole an arrangement so
generous that it is almost absurd. To this offer the Y. M. C. A. turned a
deaf ear. Their attention was concentrated on vaudeville at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> moment,
and with one hand they covered their eyes while with the other they
clutched their purse strings. The War Camp Community Service could see no
way in which the Theater could function for the men either at home or
abroad. The <i>Portmanteau</i> was, in a word, too "high-brow" a venture for
them. The reader is referred to the Appendix of this volume showing the
repertory in use at that time. Another official contented himself with the
statement that the problem of transportation involved rendered the project
impracticable. The matter is too lengthy to discuss here, but the writer,
who was able to observe the situation at first hand, knows this to be an
error. The navy then asked for plans and estimates so that a number of
<i>Portmanteau Theaters</i> might be constructed aboard the ships. Mr. Walker
offered to put all his patents at the complete disposal of the Navy
Department, and himself was ready to draw plans and make suggestions. The
navy approved the idea, and with sublime assurance requested Mr. Walker to
proceed with the work of construction&mdash;at his own expense. It was
impossible; the money could not be afforded, and the venture was abandoned.
It is therefore very evident that there was an opportunity, and that that
opportunity was lost; but it was not the <i>Portmanteau</i> which lost it. At
any rate we are left free to take up the history of Mr. Walker's theater
and his plays at the point where we left off in the first book of the
series.</p>

<p>The close of the highly successful season at the <i>Princess Theater</i> in New
York, the winter of 1915-1916, was followed by twelve weeks on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> road,
three of which were spent in Chicago, and then by thirteen weeks in
Indianapolis. It was in this last city that the production of the
adaptation of Booth Tarkington's book, "Seventeen," changed all plans by
its instant popularity. On the way East, a stop was made in Chicago, and
before that city had time to do much more than voice its enthusiasm, the
company left for New York. During the fall of 1917 <i>Seventeen</i> was played
regularly, with the addition of some special performances of the repertory.
<i>Seventeen</i> was played in New York for two hundred and fifty-eight
performances (Chicago had already had one hundred), and the special
performances of <i>The Book of Job</i> were renewed in the spring. It was during
the next fall, that of 1918, that a second <i>Seventeen</i> company was sent out
on the road. That company is still out, the total playing time for the work
since its production being (April, 1919) just one hundred and four weeks.
The next summer, 1918, included a repertory season of thirteen weeks, again
at Indianapolis, and four in Cincinnati, while the following winter, just
past, chimed ten weeks of repertory at the <i>Punch and Judy Theater</i> in New
York. To sum up in brief then&mdash;Mr. Walker has, beginning in the spring of
1916 and ending in the spring of 1919, played seventy-six weeks of
repertory, in which he has produced forty-eight plays. This does not
include the <i>Seventeen</i> run which, as I have said, totals one hundred and
four weeks to date. It is safe to claim that this represents as successful
repertory work as has been done in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> United States so far. We shall,
however, return to that presently.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1917, so important to the Portmanteau company, a change of
management was instituted, by which the following staff came into control:
Stage Director&mdash;Gregory Kelly: Stage Manager&mdash;Morgan Farley: Musical
Director&mdash;Michel Bernstein: Manager&mdash;Harold Holstein: Press
Representative&mdash;Alta May Coleman: Treasurer&mdash;Walter Herzbrun. The changes
were excellent, and were thoroughly justified in their results. An
arrangement was made with the Shuberts, whereby booking was greatly
facilitated, and with its structure thus reinforced, the Theater was in an
excellent position to "carry on."</p>

<p>It may be remembered by those who read the first book of the <i>Portmanteau
Series</i> that in my introduction I placed the greater portion of my emphasis
on the theatrical side; that is, the <i>Portmanteau</i> as a portable theater
rather than as a repertory company. It is my intention here to reverse the
process, and this for two reasons. First: Mr. Walker has in the last two
years by no means confined himself to the <i>Portmanteau</i> stage. The recent
run at the <i>Punch and Judy Theater</i> in New York was upon a full size stage,
and this was not at all an exception. The <i>Portmanteau</i> was, and is, an
idea, but that idea has no very definite connection with repertory as such.
There is no longer the need, in this particular instance, that there once
was, for the invariable use of the <i>Portmanteau</i>, except as convenience
requires.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> At the very beginning, when the company often played for private
persons, the portable stage was indispensable. But so thoroughly did the
<i>Portmanteau</i> idea justify itself that from being a crutch it grew into a
handy staff, always valuable, but no longer essential. All that has been
said of it, and of its possibilities, is quite as true today as ever it
was, but now having proved his original thesis, if so it may be called, Mr.
Walker may well be content to work out the future gradually and in his own
way. Second: the repertory idea is certainly of infinitely more importance
than any theatrical device or contrivance, however interesting and valuable
such a departure may be in itself. As to any difference in the acting
necessitated by the change from a small to a large stage that amounts to
little. It is entirely a difference in quality, an ability to temper the
interpretation to the surroundings, and as such would apply as readily to
the staging and setting of a play as to the acting itself. On a large stage
one might take three steps to convey an impression where on a small stage
one step would produce the same effect. An arch or pylon would obviously
have to be of greater proportions on a large stage than on a small one. Yet
in both these instances the ultimate effect is precisely the same. Let us
turn then to a consideration of the Portmanteau, not as a theater, but as a
repertory company.</p>

<p>There is certainly no space here, and just as certainly no necessity, for
dwelling long upon the prime importance of repertory. Several excellent
books have been written on that absorbing subject,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> and we may surely take
for granted that which we know beyond all doubt to be the truth, namely,
that repertory as opposed to the "long run" and to the "star" system is the
ultimate solution of a most vexatious and perplexing problem&mdash;how to change
the modern theater from an industry to an art. The disadvantages of the
present mode of procedure are too evident to call for recapitulation;
witness the results obtained. On the other hand there can be no question
that there is a practicable and simple panacea in repertory; see what has
been done by the Abbey company in Dublin, by Miss Horniman's players in
Manchester, by the <i>Scottish Repertory Theater</i>, on a smaller scale, in
Glasgow, by John Drinkwater's repertory theater in Birmingham, concerning
which I have, unfortunately, no exact data, but which I understand is doing
remarkable work with distinct success, and by the Portmanteau company in
the United States. It would be well also to include Charles Frohman's
season at the <i>Duke of York's Repertory Theater</i> in London; in fact the
inclusion of this seventeen weeks' season would be inevitable. Where the
experiment has failed it has failed for reasons which did not, in any way,
shape or manner, invalidate the principle at stake. Thus, to cite the great
example on our own side of the water, the <i>New Theater</i> was doomed to
failure from the very start in the fact that it was born crippled. It may
be restated to advantage, just here, that from the spring of 1916 to the
spring of 1919, a period of three years, Mr. Walker has produced
forty-eight plays, has given seventy-six weeks of repertory, and has had a
nearly unbroken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> run of one hundred and four weeks with one play which has
been commercially successful beyond the others. Of the forty-eight plays
produced during this time eighteen had never been seen before on any stage;
four were entirely new to America (except for a possible itinerant amateur
performance); and twenty-six were revivals, modern, semi-modern, and
classical. It is my belief that this record will take a creditable position
in the history of American repertory. Abroad, however, its place is less
secure, but even here the <i>Portmanteau</i> is by no means snowed under.</p>

<p>In the other great English speaking country there are four outstanding
examples of repertory work, as has already been stated. On the Continent
the situation is entirely different; there is no "problem" there, for the
repertory theater has long been an established fact. France, in the
<i>Comedi&eacute;-Fran&ccedil;aise</i>, and Germany, in several of her theaters before the
war, merely provide us with a criterion. In Great Britain, however, and in
America, we are in the process of building and adjusting, so that the
examples of one will reasonably affect the other. At the risk of being
misunderstood we shall pause long enough to call attention to the <i>Irving
Place Theatre</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of New York, a German house supporting German plays, and
attended very largely by a German clientele, but notwithstanding all this a
repertory theater of standing, and of some distinction, from which we might
learn several useful lessons. However, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> is with the Anglo-American stage
that we have to do at the moment.</p>

<p>Doubtless, first in importance comes the Abbey Theater Company of Dublin.
From December, 1905, to December, 1912, there were produced at the <i>Abbey
Theater</i> (I am unfortunately unable to include the several important tours
made) seventy-four plays, of which seven were translations. Of the rest but
few were revivals, as the history of the Irish literary movement will show.
They were plays written especially for the theater, for particular
audiences, and to achieve definite purpose as propaganda. Moreover, when
the <i>Abbey</i> was tottering on the brink of failure, Miss Horniman came to
the rescue with a substantial subsidy which enabled the theater not only to
proceed, but finally to establish itself on a sound running basis. Mr.
Walker's company has had to fight its own way from the very start.</p>

<p>In Manchester, Miss Horniman's own repertory company at the <i>Midland
Theater</i> and finally at the <i>Gaiety</i> has been distinctly and brilliantly
successful. In a period of a little more than two years there were produced
fifty-five plays; twenty-eight new, seventeen revivals of modern English
plays, five modern translations, and five classics. This is a repertory as
well balanced as it is wide. In 1910, however, there was inaugurated the
practise of producing each play for a run of one week, so that from that
time on the theater was open to the criticism of being not a repertory in
the fullest sense of the term, but a short run theater. But for that
matter, I do not think that there is a repertory theater either in England
or in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> America which fulfills the ideal conditions set down by William
Archer who had in mind, as he wrote, the repertory theater of the
Continent.</p>

<p>"When we speak of a repertory, we mean a number of plays always ready for
performance, with nothing more than a 'run through' rehearsal, which,
therefore, can be, and are, acted in such alternation that three, four or
five different plays may be given in the course of a week. New plays are
from time to time added to the repertory, and those of them which succeed
may be performed fifty, seventy, a hundred times, or even more, in the
course of one season; but no play is ever performed more than two or three
times in uninterrupted succession."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>This applies exactly to the <i>Comedi&eacute;-Fran&ccedil;aise</i>, which, in the year 1909,
presented one hundred and fifteen plays, eighteen of which were performed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
for the first time, the remainder being a part of the regular body of the
repertory of that theater. In the first decade of the present century there
were no less than two hundred and eighty-two plays added to the repertory
of the <i>Comedi&eacute;</i>. It may be of service to remember, however, that the
<i>Comedi&eacute;-Fran&ccedil;aise</i> was established by royal decree in 1680. If the <i>Globe
Theater</i> of Shakespeare's day had lived and prospered up to the present we
might have an example to match that of France.</p>

<p>It is probable that if one were to use the phrase "repertory in America"
the wise ones of the theater would raise their eye-brows stiffly and
remark, "There is none." That would be nearly true, but not altogether so.
It is my desire here to sketch in brief the early beginnings of what has
been termed the "independent theater" movement,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> from which repertory in
this country unquestionably grew, up to the time of the establishment of
the "little theaters" which now dot the country, and into which movement
that of the "independent theater" eventually merged.</p>

<p>In 1887 there was inaugurated by A. M. Palmer at the <i>Madison Square
Theater</i>, of which he was manager at that time, a series of "author's
matin&eacute;es" which appear to have been in some sense try-outs for a possible
repertory season. Only three plays were produced, however, before Mr.
Palmer decided against the scheme as impracticable. It is interesting to
note that these three plays were all by American authors&mdash;Howells,
Matthews, and Lathrop. The attempt was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span> actually not repertory in the
strict sense, but it undoubtedly marks a tendency, slight, but evident, to
incline in the right direction.</p>

<p>Some four years later, in the fall of 1891, a Mr. McDowell, son of General
McDowell of Civil War fame, started the <i>Theater of Arts and Letters</i> with
the idea of bringing literature and the drama into closer relationship.
Five plays were produced, and among the names of the authors (again they
were all natives) one finds several which have since become famous.
Commercially, the venture was a total failure, and the authors did not even
collect their full royalties. A short tour was made with several of the
more successful plays, one by Clyde Fitch (a one-act which was afterwards
expanded into <i>The Moth and the Flame</i>), one by Richard Harding Davis, and
one by Brander Matthews. All three of these were one-act. American authors
were willing enough to write plays, but they apparently could not succeed,
except in isolated instances, in writing good ones. There was evidently an
utter dearth of suitable material. Nevertheless, when foreign plays were
put on no better fortune ensued, unless they represented the old school of
pseudo melodrama, and farce adapted from the French and German, such as
Augustin Daly delighted in. Daly too had discovered that to encourage the
American playwright was to court disaster.</p>

<p>In 1897 <i>The Criterion</i>, a New York review of rather eccentric merit,
endeavored to establish the <i>Criterion Independent Theater</i> modeled on the
<i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre-Libre</i> of Antoine. A company was recruited, headed by E. J.
Henley, and performances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> were given at first the <i>Madison Square Theater</i>,
and then the <i>Berkeley Lyceum</i>. It was frankly intended that the appeal
should be to a small, select audience, and, in spite of the jeers of the
press, five plays were produced&mdash;one Norwegian, one Italian, one French,
one Spanish, and one American. A glance through the list shows us that the
American play, by Augustus Thomas, is the only one which has not since
entered into the permanent literature of the stage. Internal differences,
and imperfect rehearsals combined to overthrow the venture which, after one
season, was abandoned. The success of the last production, however, <i>El
Gran Galeoto</i>, inspired Mr. John Blair to produce Ibsen's <i>Ghosts</i> with
Miss Mary Shaw at the <i>Carnegie Lyceum</i> in 1899. From this sprang <i>The
Independent Theater</i>, generously backed financially by Mr. George Peabody
Eustis of Washington.</p>

<p>The list of the patrons of this theater reads like a chapter from "Who's
Who." Many of the men associated with the plan gave their services free or
at a nominal cost. The three persons more directly responsible for the
artistic side of the work were Charles Henry Meltzer, John Blair, and
Vaughan Kester, while among the patrons were W. D. Howells, Bronson Howard,
E. C. Stedman, E. H. Sothern, Charles and Daniel Frohman, and Sir Henry
Irving. Six plays were given, this time none of them of American origin.
The press and critics were most bitter in their denunciation of these
foreign importations, as they had been on the previous occasion. There was,
however, on the part of the audiences a definite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> tendency to let drop the
scales from their eyes, and to awake to the new forces in the drama and the
theater as represented by Ibsen, Hervieu, the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre-Libre</i>, and the
<i>Independent Theater</i>. But in spite of all this, one season's work saw the
conclusion of the project. A part of the repertory was given in other
cities, notably Boston and Washington, but, though a very real interest was
aroused, it was not sufficient to permit the company to continue. About two
thousand dollars represented the deficit at the end of the season; by no
means a discreditable balance, albeit on the wrong side of the ledger, when
one considers the circumstances. The actual results of the work are summed
up in a privately printed pamphlet written by Mr. Meltzer than whom no one
was more closely in touch with the whole independent movement.</p>

<p>"What have the American 'Independents' achieved by their efforts?</p>

<p>"They have succeeded, thanks to Mr. George Peabody Eustis, the general
manager of the scheme, in giving twenty-two performances of plays
recognized everywhere abroad as characteristic, interesting, and literary.</p>

<p>"They have extended the 'Independent' movement from New York to Boston and
Washington.</p>

<p>"They have encouraged at least one 'regular' manager to announce the
production next season of an Ibsen play.</p>

<p>"They have revived discussion of the general tendencies of modern drama.</p>

<p>"They have interested, and occasionally charmed, an intelligent minority of
playgoers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span> who have grown weary of the rank insipidity, vulgarity, and
improbability of current drama.</p>

<p>"They have bored, angered, and distressed a less intelligent majority of
playgoers and critics.</p>

<p>"They have discovered at least one new actress of unusual worth.</p>

<p>"They have prepared the way, at a by no means inconsiderable cost of time,
thought, and money, for future, and perhaps, more prosperous movements
aiming at the reform of the American stage."</p>

<p>Coming at the time it did, sponsored by the best minds in America, and
worked to its conclusion by whole hearted enthusiasts, <i>The Independent
Theater</i> did, beyond all doubt, have a very vitalizing effect on both the
stage and the drama of this country. The next step, perhaps the climactic
one of the series, was longer in coming (1909).</p>

<p>The <i>New Theater</i> has been our greatest attempt and our greatest failure.
The details of these two seasons have been placed before the public so many
times that there is no necessity for doing more here than suggesting a
broad outline. If the enterprise had, from its very inception, been in the
hands of capable men who knew their work, instead of being handicapped by
wealthy amateurs the history of a failure might never have been written. In
its first season <i>The New Theater</i> presented thirteen plays at intervals of
a fortnight. Of these, four were classics, three were original works by
native authors, and two by contemporary British dramatists. During the
second season, at the end of which the idea was given up and the <i>New
Theater</i> abandoned, eleven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span> plays were produced; six of these were of
British origin, semi-modern; one was a classic; three were Belgian, and one
was American. I have counted in this season, two plays produced the season
before, the only revivals. Altogether then, twenty-two plays were given,
only five of which can be considered as home products. Mr. Ames, the
Director, was balked at every turn by the combined forces of Fifth Avenue
and Wall Street, while the outrageous and impossible construction of the
theater itself proved an insurmountable handicap. In addition it was now
found almost impossible to induce the American dramatist to turn from the
great profits of the long run Broadway theaters to the acceptance of one
hundred and fifty dollars a performance at the <i>New Theater</i>. There was
something to be said on both sides. The <i>New Theater</i> was a splendid and
costly attempt, and it taught us several invaluable lessons, chief among
them the occasional unimportance of money.</p>

<p>Probably next in order comes the short repertory of Miss Grace George at
the <i>Playhouse</i> in 1915 and 1917. This lasted for about one season and a
half, and, while there was promise of continuation, the project was finally
abandoned. It is only fair to say that Miss George worked under the
peculiar disadvantage of entire lack of sympathy, and indeed, open
antagonism as well, on the part of several of her most important confr&eacute;res.
The real trouble seemed to be one of those that affected the <i>New Theater</i>,
that is, Miss George was totally unable to secure American plays for her
purposes. In the period of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span> her project she produced seven plays; five the
first year, and two the next. Of these, five were modern British plays, one
was a translation from the French, and one was semi-modern American. Again
it will be observed that American plays were simply not forthcoming, a
condition widely different from that obtaining during the nineties when the
<i>Theater of Arts and Letters</i>, and the <i>Criterion Independent</i> held their
short sway. Miss George's effort was distinctly worth while, but in the end
there was added only another gravestone to the cemetery of buried hopes.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>With the advent of the "little theater" movement, from about 1905, there
are many small companies and theaters which can, in a broad sense, fairly
be termed repertory. To discuss any number of them would require a book in
itself, and the reader is referred to "<i>The Insurgent Theater</i>" by
Professor Dickenson as the work most nearly fulfilling this need. Probably
the <i>Washington Square Players</i> of New York are typical, more or less, of
them all, and their repertory for two years is given in the Appendix. Aside
from the natural conditions resulting from the war, one reason of their
failure seems to have been their pernicious desire to be "different" at any
cost. In spite of their excellent work they ultimately found that cost to
be prohibitive, but the discovery was made too late.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The majority of the
little theaters are, however, too entirely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span> provincial in their appeal to
warrant an assumption of any great influence, in spite of their vital and
unquestionable importance.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>It will be observed that in speaking of Stuart Walker's work I have used
the phrase repertory <i>company</i>, not, repertory <i>theater</i>. That is, of
course, part of the secret. A theater anchored to one spot is obviously at
a disadvantage. It cannot seek its audience, but must sit with what
patience and capital it has at its disposal, and wait for the audience to
come to it. With a touring company the odds are more even. An unsuccessful
month in one city may be made up by a successful one in another. The type
of play that captivates the west may not go at all in the east, and the
other way about. There are plays now on the road, and which have been there
literally for years, doing excellent business, which have never ventured to
storm the very rocky coast bounding New York. And there are plays which
have had crowded houses in the metropolis which have slumped, and
deservedly so, most dismally when they were taken out where audiences were
possessed of a clearer vision. Hence it is easy to see that Mr. Walker,
playing in both the east and the west, in small cities and in large ones,
can do what the <i>New Theater</i> and the <i>Playhouse</i> could not do. True, they
could send their companies out on tour, but the <i>New Theater</i> with its huge
stage and panoramic scenery could find but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span> few theaters which could house
it, and the whole idea of both that and Miss George's company was a fixed
repertory theater. Indeed in both of them the faults of the "star" system
were never wholly absent.</p>

<p>The facts that I have been able to give here seem to point to but one
conclusion. That is, that Stuart Walker's repertory company stands
numerically on a par with anything else of the kind ever attempted in the
United States, and that it is not unworthy of comparison with the best
repertory work in England. It must be borne in mind that, in some measure,
all this has been done on a fairly small scale. There has not been the
money at hand to do it otherwise, nor has there been the necessity. The
company may be compared better with the <i>Gaiety</i> of Manchester than with
the <i>Duke of York's Theater</i>. And too, as with the <i>Gaiety</i>, many of the
players have been relatively unknown before their advent on the
<i>Portmanteau</i> stage. It is the definite mission, or some part of it at any
rate, of the repertory company to encourage new dramatists, new players,
and new stage effects when such encouragement is advisable. To be merely
different is by no means to be worth while.</p>

<p>The three plays included in this volume have all been presented
successfully both in the east and in the west. The two long plays&mdash;<i>The
Lady of the Weeping Willow Tree</i> and <i>Jonathan Makes a Wish</i>&mdash;both have the
distinction of being popular with audiences and unpopular with critics, a
condition of affairs not as unique as it might seem. As for the third, <i>The
Very Naked Boy</i>, it is a thoroughly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span> delightful trifle, unimportant as
drama, yet very perfect in itself, and has been liked by nearly everyone.
Combining, as it does, comedy and sentiment, it possesses all the elements
that go to make for success with the average audience.</p>

<p><i>The Lady of the Weeping Willow Tree</i> is founded on an old Japanese legend,
how old no one knows. Mr. Walker became interested in Japanese folk-lore
through a collection of ballads; it is amusing to observe how his fondness
for ballads has followed him through all his work, and this play was the
result. From the first it went well. Apparently no one could resist the
pathos of the intensely human story which culminated in so tragic a form.
One might think that the appeal in a play of this type, written by an
author so well known as an artist in stagecraft, would be largely visual.
While that appeal is unquestionably there in abundance, the real essence of
the tale is the vitally human quality of its characters. One is indeed
inclined to believe that we take our pleasures sadly, when he has seen an
audience quite dissolved in tears at a performance of this play, and all
the while enjoying themselves unutterably. It is a drama of imagination and
of emotion. The cold, hard, and more often than not deceiving light of the
intellect plays but a small part. It is the human heart with its passions,
its fears, its regrets, and its aspirations that concerns us here; not the
human mind with its essentially microcosmic point of view, and its petty,
festering egoism. The play is beautiful because it is true, and equally it
is true because it is beautiful. It seems to me quite the best and
soundest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span> piece of work Mr. Walker has done so far, though he himself
prefers his later play, <i>Jonathan Makes a Wish</i>.</p>

<p>This last play is more realistic&mdash;stupid term!&mdash;than anything of a serious
nature that the author has so far attempted. It is, however, the realism of
Barrie rather than that of Brieux, and this at any rate is consoling. The
first act is extraordinary, splendid in thought, in technique, and in
execution. Therein lies the trouble, if trouble there be. Neither of the
two acts following can reach the level of the first, and with the opening
of the second act the play gradually, though hardly perceptibly, declines,
not in interest, but in strength. The transposition of the character of the
Tramp from an easy going good nature in the first act to that of a Dickens
villain in the second may require explanation. The last sensation the boy
has is that of the blow on his head, and his last visualization is that of
the Tramp's face bending over him. Thus, in his delirium, the two would
inevitably be associated. The story of the delirium, the second act, is
peculiarly well done. One feels the slight haziness of outline, the great
consequence of actually inconsequential events, the morbid terror lurking
always in the near background, which are a very part and parcel of that
strange psychological condition which is here made to play a spiritual
part. The last act suffers for want of material. In reality, all that is
necessary is to wind up the play speedily and happily. It seems probable
that the introduction of the deliciously charming Frenchwoman, played so
delightfully by Margaret Mower, would give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span> the needed color and substance
to this portion. As it is, one feels a little something lacking&mdash;but only a
little. That the play is, as one pseudo-critic remarked, an argument in
favor of infant playwrights, is too absurd to discuss. If it argues at all,
it is that the relationship between the child world and the adult must be
democratic, not tyrannic, and that flowers grow, like weeds, only when they
are encouraged, not trod upon. The play is interesting, true, and
imaginative to a degree; if it is not wholly satisfactory, it but partakes
of the faults of virtue. Audiences, young, old, metropolitan and urban,
have responded to the work in a manner which left no doubt of their
approval. In New York it was slow in taking hold, and unfortunately the
company was obliged to leave to fill other engagements just at the time
when a more definite success was at hand. In the west the spirit of the
thing caught at once; there was no hesitation there.</p>

<p>From the beginning there has been a very definite plan in Mr. Walker's mind
as to what his objective point was to be, and especially in view of what I
have said of his company in connection with repertory it may be interesting
to suggest the outline of that plan here. This is no less than to establish
in some city a permanent repertory theater and company, and to use the
<i>Portmanteau Theater</i> and company for touring purposes. It is an amusing
thought; the little theater would shoot out from under the wing of its
parent as a raiding party detaches itself from its company, but the
consequences would be, one hopes, less destructive on both sides. The
thought, however, is really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span> much more than amusing; it is of very real
consequence and importance. It will readily be seen that in this we have a
combination of the advantages of both the stationary and the touring
repertory company, and hence, double the chances of success. And Mr. Walker
would by no means be restricted to one <i>Portmanteau Theater</i>. If conditions
warranted it he could as easily construct and send out a dozen on the road,
taking his work into every nook and corner of the theater-loving country.
In fact the ramifications of the idea are so vast that it is useless to
endeavor to do more than suggest them here. The reader will see for himself
what great possibilities are involved, and what an effect this might have
on all repertory work in America.</p>

<p>During the last two years the work of Mr. Walker's company has improved in
every way. The addition of new members, such as Margaret Mower, and
particularly George Gaul, whose performance In <i>The Book of Job</i> was, in my
opinion, one of the finest ever seen on the American stage, has naturally
served to strengthen the fabric greatly. The older members of the company,
Gregory Kelly, McKay Morris, Edgar Stehli and many others, have all
improved in their work, increasing in assurance and finish. The success
that has attended the fortunes of the theater has made possible finer stage
effects (the Dunsany productions have been immensely improved) and the
repertory has been greatly enriched by some really fine plays, and has been
enhanced by others of a more popular character. One thing must be said,
however, in all fairness. It has seemed to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span> writer that of late there
has been an increasing tendency on the part of Mr. Walker's scenic artists
and costume designers to fall away from the plain surfaces and unbroken
lines of the new stagecraft, and to achieve an effect which one can only
characterize as "spotty." This can best be appreciated by those who know
the two American productions of Dunsany's one-act play, <i>The Tents of the
Arabs</i>. I am rather regretfully of the opinion that, aside from the actual
playing and reading of the parts, Sam Hume's production was superior to
that of Mr. Walker. An opulence of variegated colors does not always
suggest as much as flat masses. The set used by Mrs. Hapgood in her
production of Torrence's <i>Simon the Cyrenian</i> illustrates excellently the
desired result. It is, however, Stuart Walker's privilege to adapt the new
ideas, and to make such use of the old, as seems best to him. One is
sometimes inclined to miss, nevertheless, the simplicity of his earlier
work, especially when it is compared with the splendor, not always well
used or well advised, of his later productions. His company has always read
beautifully, and its reading is now better than ever. The only adverse
criticism, if adverse criticism there be at all, lies against the Stage
Director himself. I am especially glad to be able to say this, for the
producer whose work is too good, too smooth, is surely stumbling to a fall.
The very fact that there is definite room for improvement in the
<i>Portmanteau</i> presentations, leads one to feel, knowing the record of the
company, that these improvements will be made.</p>

<p>To return for a moment to an earlier phase of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span> our discussion, it may be
both interesting and profitable to note the fact that while the <i>Abbey</i>,
the <i>Manchester</i>, and the <i>New Theaters</i> were all aided by material
subsidies, the <i>Portmanteau</i> has stood on its own legs, albeit they wabbled
a trifle on occasion, from the very start. A little, but only a little,
money has been borrowed, and there has been just one gift, that of $5000.
This last was accepted for the reason that it would enable the Theater to
mount sets and costume plays in a rather better fashion than heretofore.
While it was not absolutely essential to the continued existence of the
<i>Portmanteau</i> it made presently possible productions which otherwise would
have been postponed indefinitely; in British army slang it would be called
"bukshee," meaning extra, like the thirteenth cake in the dozen. The record
of the <i>Portmanteau</i> is its own, and that of its many friends who have been
generous in contributing that rarest of all gifts, sympathetic
understanding.</p>

<p>Before withdrawing my intrusive finger from the <i>Portmanteau</i> pie I should
like to pay a small tribute to Stuart Walker himself. I do not think I have
ever known a man who gave more unsparingly of himself in all his work. That
dragon of the theater, the expense account, has often necessitated someone
shouldering the work of half a dozen who were not there. Always it is Mr.
Walker who has taken the task upon his back, cheerfully and willingly, and
despite physical ills, under which a less determined man would have
succumbed. His never wavering belief in his work and his ability to do that
work have brought him through many a pitfall. It is not a petty vanity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>
but the strong conceit of the artist; that which most of us call by the
vague term ideals. The spirit of the <i>Portmanteau</i> is to be found alike in
its offices and on its stage; a spirit of unselfish belief that somehow,
somewhere, we all shall "live happily ever after" if only we do the work we
are set to do faithfully here and now. The theater, the organization which
has that behind it, in conjunction with a keenly intelligent co-operation
or team-play, will take a great deal of punishment before it goes down.
Mistakes have been made, of course; otherwise neither producer nor company
were human; but it is in the acknowledgment and rectification of errors
that men become great.</p>

<p>The repertory theater, the new drama, and stage craft, have an able ally in
the <i>Portmanteau</i>. We may look far afield for that elixir which will
transmute the base metal of the commercial theater to the bright gold of
art, but unless we remember that the pot of treasure is to be found at this
end of the rainbow, and not the other, our search will be in vain.</p>

<p>MEMORY</p>

<p>Once upon a time, but not so very long ago, you very grownups believed in
all true things. You believed until you met the Fourteen Doubters who were
so positive in their unbelief that you weakly cast aside the things that
made you happy for the hapless things that they were calling life. You were
afraid or ashamed to persist in your old thoughts, and strong in your folly
you discouraged your little boy, and other people's little boys from the
pastimes they had loved. Yet all through the early days you had been surely
building magnificent cities, and all about you laying out magnificent
gardens, and, with an April pool you had made infinite seas where pirates
fought or mermaids played in coral caves. Then came the Doubters, laughing
and jeering at you, and you let your cities, and gardens, and seas go
floating in the air&mdash;unseen, unsung&mdash;wonderful cities, and gardens, and
seas, peopled with the realest of people.... So now you, and he, and I are
met at the portals. Pass through them with me. I have something there that
you think is lost. The key is the tiny regret for the real things, the
little regret that sometimes seems to weight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> your spirit at twilight, and
compress all life into a moment's longing. Come, pass through. You cannot
lose your way. Here are your cities, your gardens, and your April pools.
Come through the portals of once upon a time, but not so very long
ago&mdash;today&mdash;now!</p>

<p><i>She passes through the soft blue curtains, but unless you are willing to
follow her, turn back now. There are only play-things here.</i></p>

<p>[<i>Before the House of Obaa-San. At the right back is a weeping willow tree,
at the left the simple little house of Obaa-San.</i></p>

<p>[<i>O-Sode-San and O-Katsu-San enter.</i></p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>Oi!... Oi!... Obaa-San!</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>Obaa-San!... Grandmother!</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>She is not there.</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>Poor Obaa-San.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>Why do you always pity Obaa-San? Are her clothes not whole? Has she not her
full store of rice?</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>Ay!</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>Then what more can one want&mdash;a full hand, a full belly, and a warm body!</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>A full heart, perhaps.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>What does Obaa-San know of a heart, silly O-Katsu? She has had no husband
to die and leave her alone. She has had no child to die and leave her arms
empty.</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>Hai! Hai! She does not know.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>She has had no lover to smile upon her and then&mdash;pass on.</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>But Obaa-San is not happy.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>Pss-s!</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>She may be lonely because she has never had any one to love or to love her.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>How could one love Obaa-San? She is too hideous for love. She would
frighten the children away&mdash;and even a drunken lover would laugh in her
ugly face. Obaa-San! The grandmother!</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>O-Sode, might we not be too cruel to her?</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>If we could not laugh at Obaa-San, how then could we laugh? She has been
sent from the dome of the sky for our mirth.</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>I do not know! I do not know! Sometimes I think I hear tears in her laugh!</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>Pss-s! That is no laugh. Obaa-San cackles like an old hen.</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>I think she is unhappy now and then&mdash;always, perhaps.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>Has she not her weeping willow tree&mdash;the grandmother?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>Ay. She loves the tree.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>The grandmother of the weeping willow tree! It's well for the misshapen,
and the childless, and the loveless to have a tree to love.</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>But, O-Sode, the weeping willow tree can not love her. Perhaps even old
Obaa-San longs for love.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>Do we not come daily to her to talk to her? And to ask her all about her
weeping willow tree?</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>Oi! Obaa-San.</p>

<p>[<i>A sigh is heard.</i></p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>What was that, O-Katsu?</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>Someone sighed&mdash;a deep, hard sigh.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>Oi! Obaa-San! Grandmother!</p>

<p>[<i>The sigh is almost a moan.</i></p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>It seemed to come from the weeping willow tree.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>O-Katsu! Perhaps some evil spirit haunts the tree.</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>Some hideous Gaki! Like the Gaki of Kokoru&mdash;the evil ghost that can feed
only on the unrest of humans. Their unhappiness is his food. He has to find
misery in order to live, and win<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> his way back once more to humanity. To
different men he changes his shape at will, and sometimes is invisible.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>Quick, Katsu, let us go to the shrine&mdash;and pray&mdash;and pray.</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>Ay. There!</p>

<p>[<i>They go out. The Gaki appears.</i></p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Why did you sigh?</p>

<p class="center">THE VOICE OF THE TREE</p>

<p>O Gaki of Kokoru! My heart hangs within me like the weight of years on
Obaa-San.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Why did you moan?</p>

<p class="center">THE TREE</p>

<p>The tree is growing&mdash;and it tears my heart.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>I live upon your unrest. Feed me! Feed me!</p>

<p>[<i>The tree sighs and moans and The Gaki seems transported with joy.</i></p>

<p class="center">THE TREE</p>

<p>Please! Please! Give me my freedom.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Where then should I feed? Unless I feed on your unhappiness I should cease
to live&mdash;and I must live.</p>

<p class="center">THE TREE</p>

<p>Someone else, perchance, may suffer in my stead.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>I care not where or how I feed. I am in the sixth hell, and if I die in
this shape I must remain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> in this hell through all the eternities. One like
me must feed his misery by making others miserable. I can not rise through
the other five hells to human life unless I have human misery for my food.</p>

<p class="center">THE TREE</p>

<p>Oh, can't you feed on joy&mdash;on happiness, on faith?</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Faith? Yes, perhaps&mdash;but only on perfect faith. If I found perfect
faith&mdash;ah, then&mdash;I dare not dream.&mdash;There is no faith.</p>

<p class="center">THE TREE</p>

<p>Do not make me suffer more. Let me enjoy the loveliness of things.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Would you have someone else suffer in your stead?</p>

<p class="center">THE TREE</p>

<p>Someone else&mdash;someone else&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Ay&mdash;old Obaa-San&mdash;she whom they call the grandmother.</p>

<p>[<i>The Tree moans.</i></p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>She will suffer in your stead.</p>

<p class="center">THE TREE</p>

<p>No! No! She loves me! She of all the world loves me! No&mdash;not she!</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>It shall be she!</p>

<p class="center">THE TREE</p>

<p>I shall not leave!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>You give me better food than I have ever known. You wait! You wait!</p>

<p class="center">THE TREE</p>

<p>Here comes Obaa-San! Do not let her suffer for me!</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>You shall be free&mdash;as free as anyone can be&mdash;when I have made the misery of
Obaa-San complete.</p>

<p class="center">THE TREE</p>

<p>She has never fully known her misery. Her heart is like an iron-bound chest
long-locked, with the key lost.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>We shall find the key! We shall find the key!</p>

<p class="center">THE TREE</p>

<p>I shall warn her.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Try!</p>

<p class="center">THE TREE</p>

<p>Alas! I can not make her hear! I can not tell her anything.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>She can not understand you! She can not see me unless I wish! Earth people
never see or hear!</p>

<p class="center">THE TREE</p>

<p>Hai! Hai! Hai!</p>

<p>[<i>Obaa-San enters. She is old, very, very old, and withered and misshapen.
There is only laughter in your heart when you look at Obaa-San unless you
see her eyes. Then</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>My tree! My little tree! Why do you sigh?</p>

<p class="center">THE TREE</p>

<p>Hai! Hai! Hai!</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Sometimes I think I pity you. Yes, dear tree!</p>

<p class="center">THE TREE</p>

<p>Hai! Hai! Hai!</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Now I am a traveller. She sees me pleasantly.&mdash;Grandmother!</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Ay, sir!</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Which way to Kyushu?</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>You have lost your way. Far, far back beyond the ferry landing at Ishiyama
to your right. That is the way to Kyushu.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Ah, me!</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>You are tired. Will you not sit and rest?&mdash;Will you not have some rice?</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Oh, no.&mdash;Where is your brood, grandmother?</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>I have no brood. I am no grandmother. I am no mother.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>What! Are there tears in your voice?</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Tears! Why should I weep?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>I do not know, grandmother!</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>I am no grandmother!&mdash;Who sent you here to laugh at me?&mdash;O-Sode-San? 'Tis
she who laughs at me, because&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>No one, old woman&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Yes, yes, old woman. That is it. Old woman!&mdash;Who are you? I am not wont to
cry my griefs to any one.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Griefs? You have griefs?</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Ay! Even <i>I</i>&mdash;she whom they call Obaa-San&mdash;have griefs.&mdash;Even I! But they
are locked deep within me. No one knows!</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Someone must know.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>I shall tell no one.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Someone must know!</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>You speak like some spirit&mdash;and I feel that I must obey.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Someone must know!</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>I shall not speak. Who cares?&mdash;What is it I shall do? Tell my story&mdash;unlock
my heart&mdash;so that O-Sode-San may laugh and laugh and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> laugh. Is it not
enough that some evil spirit feeds upon my deep unrest?</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>How can one feed upon your unrest when you lock it in your heart? (<i>The
voices of O-Sode-San and O-Katsu-San are heard calling to Obaa-San</i>) Here
come some friends of yours. Tell them your tale.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes out.</i></p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Strange. I feel that I must speak out my heart.</p>

<p>[<i>O-Sode-San and O-Katsu-San come in.</i></p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>Good morning, grandmother!</p>

<p>OBAA-SAN (<i>with a strange wistfulness in her tone</i>)</p>

<p>Good morning, O-Sode-San. Good morning, O-Katsu-San. May the bright day
bring you a bright heart.</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>And you, Obaa-San.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>How is the weeping willow tree, grandmother?</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>It is there&mdash;close to me.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>And does it speak to you, grandmother&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>I am no grandmother! I am no grandmother! I am no mother! O-Sode, can you
not understand? I am no mother.&mdash;I am no wife.&mdash;There is no one.&mdash;I am only
an old woman.&mdash;In the spring I see the world turn green and I hear the song
of happy birds and feel the perfumed balmy air upon my cheek&mdash;and every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
spring that cheek is older and more wrinkled and I have always been alone.
I see the stars on a summer night and listen for the dawn&mdash;and there never
has been a strong hand to touch me nor tiny fingers to reach out for me. I
have heard the crisp autumn winds fight the falling leaves and I have known
that long winter days and nights were coming&mdash;and I have always been
alone&mdash;alone. I have pretended to you&mdash;what else could I do? Grandmother!
Grandmother! Every time you speak the name, the emptiness of my life stands
before me like a royal Kakemono all covered with unliving people.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>You never seemed to care.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Did I not care! Grandmother! Grandmother! Why? Because I loved a weeping
willow tree. Because to me it was real. It was my baby. But no lover ever
came to woo. No words ever came to me.&mdash;Think you, O-Sode-San, that the
song of birds in the branches is ease to an empty heart. Think you that the
wind amongst the leaves soothes the mad unrest in here. (<i>She beats her
breast</i>) I have no one&mdash;no one. I talk to my weeping willow tree&mdash;but there
is no answer&mdash;no answer, O-Sode-San&mdash;only stillness&mdash;and yet&mdash;sometimes I
think I hear a sigh.&mdash;Grandmother! Grandmother! There! Is that enough? I've
bared my heart to you. Go spread the news&mdash;I am lonely and old&mdash;old.&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
have always been lonely. Go spread the news.</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>No, Obaa-San. We shall not spread the news. No one shall know.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>But&mdash;we pity you.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>I need no pity.&mdash;Now my heart is unlocked. The dread Gaki of Kokoru who
feeds upon unrest can come to me and feed upon my pain. I care not.</p>

<p class="center">THE TREE</p>

<p>Hai! Hai! Hai!</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>Someone sighs.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Yes. It is my tree. Perhaps there, too, someone in deep distress is
imprisoned&mdash;as I am imprisoned in this body.&mdash;Hai! You do not know. You do
not know!</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>Obaa-San&mdash;we have been hurting. I never knew&mdash;I am sorry, Obaa-San.</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>You have been lonely, Obaa-San, but you have always been lonely. I know the
having and I know the losing.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>Ay. 'Tis better to long for love than to have it&mdash;and then lose. Look at
me, whom the villagers call the bitter one. He came to me so long ago.&mdash;It
was spring, Obaa-San, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> perfume filled the air and birds were singing
and his voice was like the voice from the sky-dome&mdash;all clear and
wonderful. Together we saw the cherry trees bloom&mdash;<i>once</i>: and on a summer
night we saw the wonder of the firefly f&ecirc;te. My heart was young and life
was beautiful. We watched the summer moon&mdash;and when the autumn came&mdash;Ai!
Ai! Ai! Obaa-San.&mdash;I knew a time of love&mdash;and oh, the time of hopelessness!
And I shut my heart. I did not see, Obaa-San.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>You knew his love, O-Sode-San. You touched his hand.</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>But what is that? To her&mdash;my little girl&mdash;I gave all my dreams. I felt her
baby hands in mine and in the night I could reach out to her. I lived for
her. And then, one day&mdash;Obaa-San, I had known the joy of motherhood and I
had known the ecstasy of&mdash;child&mdash;and now&mdash;Her little life with me was only
a dream of spring, but still my back is warm with the touch of her
babyhood. The little toys still dance before my eyes. Oh, that was long
ago.&mdash;Now all is black.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>All blackness can never fill a mother's heart.&mdash;O-Katsu-San, you have known
the baby's hand in yours. But I am old&mdash;and I have never known, can never
know.&mdash;I'd go to the lowest hells if once I might but know the touch of my
own child's hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">THE TREE</p>

<p>Hai! Hai! Hai</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Just once&mdash;for one short day&mdash;to fill the empty place in my heart that has
always been empty&mdash;and a pain&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>Who is that man, Obaa-San?</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>There? That is a stranger seeking for Kyushu.</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>He seems to wish to speak to you.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>A strange man. 'Twas he who seemed to make me unlock my heart to you.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>Then shall we go.&mdash;And we'll return, Obaa-San.</p>

<p>No, mother&mdash;</p>

<p>Obaa-San, my mother.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>I have but just found my way.</p>

<p>My pain is stilled. There is no emptiness. It is a dream&mdash;a dream of spring
and butterflies&mdash;Aoyagi!</p>

<p>[<i>She stretches out her arms and silently Aoyagi glides into them&mdash;as

<p>Oh, mother dear, it is now&mdash;and now is always, if we will.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>It seems as though the weeping willow tree had warmed and shown its heart
to me.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>I am the Lady of the Weeping Willow tree!</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>I care not who or what you are. You are here&mdash;close to my heart and I have

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>[<i>The Gaki appears.</i></p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Such happiness. Already she has forgotten the coming of the man.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Oh, how I've dreamed of you! When I was very, very young and had my little
doll, I dreamed of you. I used to sing a lullaby and still I sing it in my
heart:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>I grew into womanhood and still I dreamed of you. And, dreaming still, I
grew old. And all the world it seemed to me, made sport of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> my longing and
my loneliness. The people of the village called me grandmother. The
children echoed the grownups' cry and ran from me. Now&mdash;Aoyagi&mdash;you are
here. Oh, the warmth&mdash;the peace. Come let me gather flowers for the house.
Let me&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Oh, mother, dear. I am so happy here.</p>

<p>OBAA-SAN (<i>suddenly becoming the solicitous mother, she handles Aoyagi as
one might handle a doll</i>)</p>

<p>Are you&mdash;truly?&mdash;Are you warm?&mdash;You are hungry!</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>No&mdash;I am just happy.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>You seem very happy, Aoyagi. And your mother is very happy, too.&mdash;And I am
hungry now.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>You will not hurt her! Let me go back to the Weeping Willow Tree&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>That would kill her&mdash;perhaps.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>No&mdash;no&mdash;I should be near her then&mdash;always.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

starve and I must live.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>See!</p>

seem to cleave the mirrored sky that lies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> deep within the dark waters, so
we must go, we two, just you and I, to some silent place where only you and
I may be&mdash;and look and look until we see the thousand years of love in each

<p>Look&mdash;out there&mdash;a mountain gleaming in the fresh spring air.&mdash;Amongst the
trees I know a glade that waits for you and me.&mdash;A little stream comes
plashing by and silver fishes leap from pool to pool&mdash;dazzling jewels in
the leaf-broken sunlight. Tall bamboo trees planted deep in the father
earth reach up to the sky.&mdash;And there the hand of some great god can reach
down to us and feed our happiness&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Riki&mdash;I must go&mdash;I feel the strong hand leading me&mdash;I feel the happy
pain&mdash;I long&mdash;I would stay with Obaa-San; but, Riki, I must go.&mdash;Yon
mountain gleaming in the sun&mdash;the bamboo trees&mdash;the silver fishes&mdash;you&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">RIKI</p>

<p>I could not fail. I have searched for her always.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>We always search for someone&mdash;we humans.&mdash;Sometimes we find&mdash;sometimes we
wait always.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Riki, I must not go. Obaa-San is my mother&mdash;and I am all she has.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Yes, Aoyagi, you are all I have and that is why I can let you go. Be
happy&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>But you, my mother.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>For my sake, be happy. Some day I shall be Obaa-San no more&mdash;and what of
you then? Go, my little darling, go with Riki.&mdash;Some day, you will return.</p>

<p class="center">RIKI</p>

<p>We shall return some day, Obaa-San.</p>

<p>I opened my arms here&mdash;like this.&mdash;She stepped into them as though she had
been there always&mdash;and now she has gone.&mdash;In one short moment I lived my
mother-life.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>It was magic! Come, Obaa-San, we'll make some prayers to burn.</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>Some evil ghost.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>No! No! Some kindly spirit from the sky-dome came to me.&mdash;I have had one
moment of happiness complete.&mdash;I dreamed and I have known. Now I shall
dream again&mdash;a greater dream&mdash;a greater dream.</p>

<p>My little princess! I did not come to you sword in hand; I did not fight my
way from Kyushu to Koban. But I strove for you through forest, marsh and
mountain pass.&mdash;Within me throbbed a mighty song that I could not sing. I
saw almost all the world, it seems, and once I heard a voice that seemed to
call to me alone. It was at the ferry of Ishiyama. I followed the
sound&mdash;and there she stood all aglow in the morning sunlight. But when I
saw, the song still throbbed within my heart and I could not sing to
her.&mdash;Someone else called to me&mdash;"Hai! Hai! Hai!"</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>And what of her&mdash;the vision at the ferry of Ishiyama?</p>

<p class="center">RIKI</p>

<p class="center">RIKI</p>

you.&mdash;I saw her&mdash;the song staid locked in my heart for you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not understand it all.&mdash;Obaa-San&mdash;you&mdash;this happiness.&mdash;I have known
happiness, but not like this.&mdash;When I was in the weeping willow
tree&mdash;sometimes I was happy and sometimes I was hurt.&mdash;Oh, Riki, Riki, this
glade is like the weeping willow tree! Whenever the soft air sways the
leaves, I feel the same sweet joy as when the little breezes played amongst
my branches. The rain&mdash;oh, the gentle little rain that cooled me in the hot
summer&mdash;the drops that danced from leaf to leaf and felt like smiles upon
my face. Tears! The rain is not like tears, Riki.</p>

<p class="center">RIKI</p>

<p>The dew is tears, perhaps.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>The dew! It came to me like a cool veil that the morning sun would lift and
little breezes bear away. Then sometimes&mdash;the voice, the loneliness of
Obaa-San.</p>

<p class="center">RIKI</p>

<p>Look where her home lies. Far down there beyond that stream, see&mdash;there is
Kyushu.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Oh, Riki, my Riki, my august lord, why, why can I stay here in happiness
with you when I know that Obaa-San is miserable and alone?</p>

<p class="center">RIKI</p>

<p>I can not say? I only know that we are here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>&mdash;you and I&mdash;and we are happy.
Two make a world, Aoyagi. Why? How? I do not know.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Can we not send a message to Obaa-San?</p>

<p class="center">RIKI</p>

<p>Yes. I shall go down the mountain to the road and tell some passer-by.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>And I?</p>

<p class="center">RIKI</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>There is Kyushu. (<i>She indicates the silver stream</i>)</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>I am told there is a ferry on the way to Kyushu.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>I merely echoed your own words.</p>

<p>Yes, my august lord.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>I passed no one&mdash;except&mdash;a tall woman who was climbing slowly and singing a
wonderful song&mdash;which I had heard once near the ferry at Ishiyama.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>But Riki just left me here. You must have passed him on the way.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>The by-paths are many and the trysting places are secret&mdash;like this.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Riki would take no by-path. My august lord needs no trysting place save
this.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>I do not know. I saw no Riki.</p>

<p>They?</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>He did not speak that at Ishiyama. He made that for me.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>I heard it, strange to say, at Ishiyama. Perhaps they brought it
from&mdash;where did you say?</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>He made that for me only yesterday.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>And I heard it&mdash;yesterday&mdash;at Ishiyama. There the wonderful woman was
singing. (<i>She looks at him</i>) The one I passed just now.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>I should not have told anything.&mdash;Forgive me.&mdash;I did not know.&mdash;To speak
truth is deep in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> my heart.&mdash;I have no gracious subtleties.&mdash;I am sorry&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>In the valley there is a mist. I can no longer see the silver stream at

<p>[<i>There is no answer.</i></p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Yes.&mdash;There is a mist in the valley and I can not see the silver stream at
Kyushu&mdash;</p>

<p>No demon came. You were gone too long.</p>

<p>Aoyagi!</p>

<p>[<i>He goes out. Obaa-San turns to the empty house&mdash;the empty willow tree.</i></p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>She will come back to me.</p>

<p>[<i>She goes into the house. The Gaki enters.</i></p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Foolish Riki! He searches in the valley. Mad Aoyagi! Alone with the lonely
stars!&mdash;Oh, wondrous misery that makes itself.</p>

<p>[<i>He sees Obaa-San. She enters from the house.</i></p>

<p>Good-morning, Obaa-San, my friend.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Why do you rise before the dawn?</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>I could not rest.&mdash;Why are you not at Kyushu?</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>There is a mist at Kyushu&mdash;and I feared to lose my way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Did you pass a little lady&mdash;Aoyagi, by name&mdash;alone&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>It seems&mdash;I met a little lady.&mdash;She was not happy.&mdash;That one?</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Where?</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>I am a stranger here&mdash;I cannot say. Over there&mdash;or over there.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>She will come to me, perhaps.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Do you know her?</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>She is my daughter,&mdash;Aoyagi.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Do you not fear for her?</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Perhaps.&mdash;She will be here soon.&mdash;Riki has gone for her.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>She must know the way.</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>Obaa-San, is it not wonderful to put a joy or pain in words?</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Ah, yes&mdash;if there is anyone to hear them. All my long, long years before
Aoyagi came to me, my heart sang, and words freighted with my dreams and my
love would come to me&mdash;here; and they would die because they found no ear

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>He has gone to search for you.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Was he alone?</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Alone?</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Yes. Was there no woman with him&mdash;a lady from Ishiyama?</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>A lady from&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>He was alone. A lady from Ishiyama&mdash;(<i>Aoyagi shudders with dread</i>) brought
me a message in the early night&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>It was she&mdash;young?</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>No&mdash;old.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Had she seen Riki?</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Yes. On the mountain-side&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>The stranger said she was young and fair.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Perhaps the stranger did not see with honest eyes.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>He would not lie.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Sometimes the eyes and the ears lie.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Ah!</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>And if she had been young and fair?</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Riki met her in a glade.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Did you see them meet?</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>No&mdash;she was singing.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>A happy song, perhaps.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>She sang the song he made to me.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>How do you know?</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Riki said she knew his song to me.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Ah, that is beautiful, that she should love his song to you.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>He&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>My little darling, I do not know what really happened; but this I know, you
did not speak fairly to Riki or Riki did not speak fairly to you. Almost
every unhappiness comes because we speak too much of our pride and speak
too little of our hearts.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>I asked him if he saw her.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>A stranger told me&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Was it the stranger you believed before Riki could defend himself?</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>But, mother, I gave my all in all to Riki. He does not care.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Do you know?</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>I asked Riki if they met?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Did he tell you?</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>He seemed to be proud to tell.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Then he was unashamed to tell&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>I asked him questions.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>But did you ask him the great question in your heart?</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Oh&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Did you say, "Riki, my love, you are in all my heart. Am I in all yours?"</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>He told me that.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>And did you believe?</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Above all the world!</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Then why doubt him later?</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>The lady from Ishiyama passed by.</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>My child, a lady bound for Ishiyama passed by! Had she been singing all the
love-songs of all the worlds; had she been fairer than the lotus-flower,
why should you have doubted Riki?</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>A stranger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>A stranger!&mdash;a stranger!&mdash;Oh, why&mdash;why&mdash;why do the eyes of love grow blind
because a stranger speaks? You, Aoyagi, did not see the lady bound for
Ishiyama. You did not hear her song&mdash;and yet upon the ears and eyes of a
stranger you would shatter your love.&mdash;I saw the lady.&mdash;She was
singing.&mdash;She was not fair.&mdash;If she had been&mdash;Oh, my little child&mdash;Riki is
Riki, your august lord, the lord of your life. When he comes back, go to
him and speak from your heart.</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>What shall I say?</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>I need not tell your heart.&mdash;It is only your head that can not learn to
speak unprompted.&mdash;Do you love Riki?</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Ay&mdash;so dearly!</p>

<p>[<i>The voice of Riki is heard.</i></p>

<p>Aoyagi!</p>

<p>[<i>When he sees she is safe, he drops suddenly. She goes to him.</i></p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Riki, my august lord, listen to my heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>&mdash;Forget my anger.&mdash;Tell me once
again that you love me.&mdash;I'll believe.</p>

<p>You know&mdash;I have always loved you.&mdash;When you were a song in my heart, I
loved you so! And now&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>Oh, Riki, can we ever forget the blow I struck?</p>

<p class="center">RIKI</p>

<p>That was yesterday&mdash;see, this is today: the dawn has spread across the sky.
What shall we do? Look back upon the bitterness of yesterday, or try to see
the fears of tomorrow, or live in the gladness of today?</p>

<p class="center">AOYAGI</p>

<p>The Gaki of Kokoru is here at the tree. He will not let us live in
happiness. He let me go with you because he meant to feed upon the misery
of poor Obaa-San.</p>

<p class="center">RIKI</p>

<p>He has not come upon us yet. We are struggling against tomorrow. This is
the dawning of today.</p>

<p>[<i>Obaa-San enters from the house.</i></p>

<p>There is love!&mdash;Now what shall I do for misery? Old Obaa-San remembers
happiness. She has taught O-Katsu and O-Sode to remember happiness. The
lovers are reunited;&mdash;now they understand.&mdash;And I&mdash;I, ah, I must die in
this dread shape and stay in this hell through all the eternities unless I
bring new misery to them. What can I do? (<i>He turns to see the tree</i>) Ah&mdash;I
shall kill the tree&mdash;slowly&mdash;slowly&mdash;and I'll feed upon them all. Aoyagi is
bound to the tree as one is bound to his body in a dream.&mdash;I'll kill the

<p>Give her back to us! Feed on me!</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>In your heart there is only hope and beautiful memory. Old fool, I can not
feed on you.&mdash;But now in my arms I hold the precious gift by which I shall
pass from hell to hell.</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>Take me!</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Silly old woman, you, too, like Obaa-San, can not feed me. Age learns to
grasp at bubbles and pretend that they are stars.</p>

<p class="center">O-KATSU-SAN</p>

<p>But I shall dream of my little girl.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Ay, dream of her and have tender memories that are not pain.</p>

<p class="center">O-SODE-SAN</p>

<p>I shall think of him and long for him, my lover.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>Ay, and in the memory of the firefly f&ecirc;te you'll make a poem that will
leave you all melting-like and holy&mdash;then where shall I feed?</p>

<p class="center">RIKI</p>

<p>Obaa-San, are you content? I'll let her die at my own hand before I'll let
him live.</p>

<p>[<i>He draws his dagger and leaps toward The Gaki; but old Obaa-San is too
swift for him. She catches his hand.</i></p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>Riki! Would you kill the evil by killing the joy of us all?</p>

<p class="center">RIKI</p>

<p>But the joy&mdash;my little Aoyagi&mdash;can not live so. See&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>O Gaki of Kokoru&mdash;I stand before you, no longer a suppliant. I am old and
in my years I have known all the wanting, all the hopelessness one can know
in life. But in your evil way, you brought to me a moment of happiness
yesterday and in that moment I saw the beauty that I had always believed
must be and yet that I had never known. In your evil arms you hold the
treasure of my life&mdash;you hold the songs that filled the heart of Riki. But
you do not feed, oh, Gaki of Kokoru. You can not feed. Oh, Gaki, what is
this sixth hell of yours?&mdash;Who made it? Some man who was afraid of the joy
of life;&mdash;it was too beautiful for his belief. Misery makes itself: so
happiness makes itself. You stand before us, holding the darling of our
dreams, but there is no misery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> so great as yours. See! I stand before
you&mdash;unafraid&mdash;and in my heart lies happiness.&mdash;Aoyagi rested in my arms
and my breast is warm and there is a glory where her dear head lay. In my
life&mdash;if you take her from me&mdash;there will be an emptiness.&mdash;There will be
long silences in the days to come; but my breast will still be warm with
her touch and my ears will still hear the sweet words you cannot unsay&mdash;the
lullaby I sang.&mdash;Oh, Gaki&mdash;it has been sung to her.&mdash;The climbing to the
mountain gleaming in the sun&mdash;the glade where love found the perfect
mystery&mdash;that cannot be undone whether we live or die.&mdash;Love that has been
can never be undone.</p>

<p>[<i>The Gaki looks from one to the other, but finds only that splendid
happiness that is almost pain. He loosens his hold upon Aoyagi and turns to
Riki with her.</i></p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>She is yours!&mdash;I have met perfect faith.&mdash;Five hells lie before me&mdash;but I
have met a perfect faith.&mdash;You cannot know what wonder I am knowing. From
the sixth hell I have seen a perfect faith.&mdash;I am content to die in this
shape. Strike, Riki!</p>

<p class="center">RIKI</p>

<p>I have my love.</p>

<p class="center">THE GAKI</p>

<p>But a peace has come upon me, a peace that I have never known.&mdash;I seem to
be on wings&mdash;afloat in the sky.&mdash;Stars and suns swing gently by&mdash;and cool
clouds brush my brow.&mdash;Five hells lie before me.&mdash;Can it be, in each I
shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> find peace like this?&mdash;(<i>He falls on his knees</i>) Now a fire rages
deep in me&mdash;a pain&mdash;I'm torn.&mdash;Oh, Obaa-San, I die&mdash;I die.&mdash;Come to
me&mdash;touch me&mdash;let me feel your gentle hands.&mdash;So! So!&mdash;I have never known
such gentleness.&mdash;Oh, I am cold&mdash;cold! Hold me&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>He rises&mdash;sways&mdash;and falls. It is full day. The Gaki rises wonderfully.</i></p>

<p>Obaa-San&mdash;I see&mdash;I see.&mdash;The hells were made by some man afraid of the joy
of life.&mdash;It was too beautiful for his belief.&mdash;Riki&mdash;Aoyagi, there is the
mountain gleaming in the morning light.&mdash;Go&mdash;see your footprints side by
side.&mdash;A Gaki's feet trod upon them, but left no mark&mdash;and they are there
side by side.&mdash;O-Sode-San, I look across the River of Heaven;&mdash;there stands
your lover waiting for you&mdash;an empty boat is here to bear you to
him.&mdash;O-Katsu-San,&mdash;the messenger of the other world bears your little one
upon his broad, warm back.&mdash;They are smiling, O-Katsu-San&mdash;Obaa-San&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>He points to Riki and Aoyagi. Obaa-San goes to them and lays her hands
upon them.</i></p>

<p class="center">OBAA-SAN</p>

<p>My little girl!&mdash;my little boy!&mdash;Today the sun is very bright.</p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>I didn't run away&mdash;</p>

<p>I just <i>came</i> out here.</p>

<p class="center">HE (<i>hoping it isn't true</i>)</p>

<p class="center">SHE (<i>with sphinx-like indifference</i>)</p>

<p>Why should I avoid you?</p>

<p class="center">HE</p>

<p>Genevieve! You make it impossible for me to talk to you.... I'll apologise
if it will help.</p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>Why should you apologise?</p>

<p class="center">HE</p>

<p>Perhaps I've misconstrued your meaning.</p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>I didn't mean <i>anything</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>He smiles pleasantly with more hope than discretion.</i></p>

<p>&mdash;because I didn't do it.</p>

<p class="center">HE</p>

<p>Now, Genevieve, I saw you do it.</p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>You'll have to excuse me, Mr. Gordon, from further discussion.</p>

<p>[<i>She seats herself, fully prepared for all the discussion she can force

<p>But, Genevieve&mdash;</p>

free white and twenty-one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HE (<i>with a frail attempt at humor</i>)</p>

<p>You did last night.</p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>That was different. You were Dr. Jekyll last night.</p>

<p class="center">HE</p>

<p>Joe squeezed your hand.</p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>Well, it's my hand, and besides I don't see why I should be

you all day long, I lie awake at night wondering what stars are looking
upon you and I find myself envying them&mdash;every one of them.</p>

<p>[<i>She tries to speak, but he presses her head against his shoulder.</i></p>

<p>I won't listen. You must hear me out. I've waited days and days and days
for this chance to speak to you, and you've trailed me about
like&mdash;like&mdash;like a poodle. I'm tired of it because I love you so.</p>

<p class="center">HE</p>

<p>I want you to marry me, and marry me you shall if I have to carry you away
with me. Oh, Genevieve, my darling Genevieve, just know that for this
moment I am almost completely happy. You are close to me and I do not feel
any struggle against me. Oh, if you will only listen to me, I do not mean
to be brutal. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> have torn your dress. I have mussed your precious hair.

better and I think it's an outrage for you to subject your sister to this
fright. We can't go out of here just now&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> you're making it very
embarrassing for us.</p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon&mdash;there's a cape in that closet. Will you get it for Bob.... He
says he's cold.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes to the closet.</i></p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>Bob, I'll get even with you. You ought to be ashamed. I'm humiliated.</p>

<p class="center">BOY</p>

<p>Why&mdash;Sis?</p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>Imagine my being with a gentleman and having a very naked boy pop into the
conversation.</p>

<p>[<i>He returns with the cape.</i></p>

<p class="center">HE</p>

<p>Here's the cape.</p>

<p>[<i>He tosses it over the Boy's head and suddenly leans over and kisses her.</i></p>

<p class="center">BOY</p>

<p>Why don't you smother me!</p>

<p>[<i>Boy begins to emerge.</i></p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>Bob, be careful.</p>

<p>[<i>He and She turn away.</i></p>

<p><i>The Boy rises and as he does so the cloak falls about him until, when he
steps out of the curtains, he discloses trousers and shoes.</i></p>

<p class="center">BOY</p>

<p>I can't go through the hall looking like this.</p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>You must.</p>

<p class="center">HE (<i>turning</i>)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Go away, Bob. Your sister is very nervous.</p>

<p>[<i>He sees the boy fairly well clothed. He gasps.</i></p>

<p class="center">HE</p>

<p>Why&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>Bob&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>Turning she sees the boy fairly well clothed.</i></p>

<p>I thought&mdash;How did you&mdash;Why didn't you&mdash;What were you doing in there?</p>

<p class="center">BOY</p>

<p>Father was going to get strict and keep me off the water tonight and just
as I came down here to get my sweater I heard him coming to the coat room
so I jumped behind the curtains and let him pass and then Joe and Ethel
came in and I couldn't let them see me this way. And then somebody else
came and then you came in&mdash;well, I got cold.</p>

<p>HE (<i>looking out</i>)</p>

<p>Run on now, Bob, the hall is clear.</p>

<p>[<i>Boy starts.</i></p>

<p class="center">BOY</p>

<p>Why didn't you do it?</p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>I didn't do anything.</p>

<p class="center">BOY</p>

<p>He said Joe squeezed your hand.</p>

<p>Well, I hope not, because he and Ethel got engaged in here too!</p>

<p>[<i>He and She look fondly at each other and He murmurs</i>, "Genevieve" <i>as he

<h2>ACT I</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Jonathan Makes a Friend</span></h4>


<p>[<i>The scene represents the lumber room in the carriage house on John Clay's
suburban estate. The room is crowded with old trunks, paintings, barrels,
boxes, chests, furniture showing long residence during slow epochs of
changing taste. Everything is in good order and carefully labelled. At the
right of the room is a door opening onto the stairs which lead to the
ground floor. A small window is set high in the peak of the gabled end up
centre. At the left a chimney comes through the floor and cuts into the
roof as though it had been added by Victorian standards of taste for
exterior beautification. An open stove intrudes its pipe into the chimney.
The single indication of the life of today having touched the place is the
studied arrangement of an old rosewood square grand piano. The keyboard is
uncovered. On the top is a tiny theatre&mdash;a model masked and touched with
mystery, according to early adolescent standards. Two benches stand in
front of the piano, and the piano stool is meticulously set in place. A
flamboyant placard leaning against the music rack announces:</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The light in the room is dim, although it is quite bright out of doors.
There are two low windows which are heavily barred. The little theatre is
so arranged that when the manipulator stands on the box to work it, his
head can be seen over the masking.</i></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>The curtain rises disclosing an empty room. Presently laborious steps are
heard on the stairs and a key is turned in the lock. Then Aunt Letitia
enters followed by Susan Sample. Aunt Letitia is a motherly old woman who
has been in the Clay home for many years. She may have preferences, but
like the buildings on the estate, she stays where she is. Susan Sample is a
tall, slender girl of fourteen with a very gentle manner and a way of
looking at people that indicates a receptivity rarely met in one so old.
Letitia goes to one of the trunks marked E R in large white letters and
unlocks it.</i></p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Here they are, my dear. Help me with the hasps.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>What does E. R. really stand for, Mis' Letitia?</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>E. R.... That's a secret, Susan, that little girls aren't supposed to
know.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>I won't tell.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>But what good would that do, my sweet? Please open the windows.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN (<i>opening the window and returning to her question</i>)</p>

<p>No one would know you told me.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>I would know. Yes, I would know that I had told somebody else's secret.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Whose secret is it? Please.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>I've been living in this house for thirty-five years, Susan, and I've known
the secrets of all the boys and girls from time to time.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>You know mine, too.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>And I've never told one of them, either.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Does old Mr. John ever have secrets?</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p><i>Old</i> Mr. John! For shame!... Of course he has secrets.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>I wish I knew some of his, Mis' Letitia.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>My dear, you never will know them. John is very quiet.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Who in the family didn't have any secrets at all?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Oh, they all had secrets when they were young. Nathaniel had <i>fewer</i> than
any of them and...</p>

<p>[<i>Her words are lost tenderly in a memory.</i></p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Why hasn't he ever come back home?</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA (<i>as she busies herself with the contents of the trunk</i>)</p>

<p>That is his secret, Susan, and we mustn't ask too many questions. Nathaniel
is coming today. I won't ask any questions.... He was a fine young man.
Yes, he's coming back today, my dear. He was the baby of the family.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>How old is he now?</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>You little chatterbox! Between you and Jonathan I have to fight to keep
anybody's secrets.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Does Jonathan ask many questions?</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>When we're alone he does. He's just like his Uncle Nathaniel. God bless
him!</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN (<i>seeing a costume in the trunk</i>)</p>

<p>Oh, isn't that just wonderful!</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA (<i>holding the costume up for Susan to see</i>)</p>

<p><i>That</i> is what you can wear in the pageant, my dear Susan.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN (<i>taking the costume</i>)</p>

<p>Oh! Oh! Oh!... I wish I knew whose it was.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Would that make it any prettier?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>No, but I'd like to know just the same.... Was it E. R.'s?</p>

<p>[<i>A cry is heard outside</i>, "Aunt Letty! Aunt Letty!"</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Oh, Susan, it's Nathaniel! It's my boy. Here I am, dear.</p>

<p>[<i>She has an armful of costumes which she drops nervously.</i></p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Mis' Letitia, I believe you love him best of all!</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>No, I don't, but I always understood him, I think.</p>

<p>[<i>The voice below calls again</i>, "Where are you?"</p>

<p>Come up here, my boy. Come up to the lumber room.</p>

<p>[<i>Steps are heard on the stairs, young eager steps, and Nathaniel Clay
bursts into the room. He is an eternally young man of thirty-five, who has
touched the dregs and the heights of the world and remained himself.</i></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL [<i>taking Letitia in his arms, then holding her from him as he
inspects her.</i></p>

<p>Aunt Letty! Not a day older.... But oh, so wise.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Nathaniel, my boy, my darling, darling boy.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Now, now. Don't cry.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>My boy, my boy. My splendid boy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>[<i>Susan has forgotten her costume in her admiration for Nathaniel. She puts
it down on the bench in front of the piano.</i></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>And this is&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>This is Susan Sample.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Not&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Yes, time has been flying, Nathaniel. This young lady is Mary Sample's
daughter.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>How do you do? I can't believe it. You were only a little pink cherub up
there in the sky when I ran&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA (<i>hurriedly interrupting him</i>)</p>

<p>Yes, Susan was born three years after you went away.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Oh!... And, Aunt Letitia, you've opened Emily's trunk!</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Yes, Susan is going to be in a pageant.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Who was Emily?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>She was&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Nathaniel dear, you must not satisfy her curiosity.</p>

<p>(<i>To Susan</i>)</p>

<p>You go find Jonathan, dear, and tell him that his uncle is here.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>To Nathaniel</i>)</p>

<p>I'll put these things away, and we'll go into the house.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN (<i>reluctantly</i>)</p>

<p>Good-bye, Mr. Clay.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Good-bye, Susan. You'll come back, won't you?</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Oh, yes. Good-bye.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Good-bye.</p>

<p>[<i>Susan goes out.</i></p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>She hates to go. She's never seen anyone just like you: and I have only
seen one.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Who's Jonathan?</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>He's the one.... He's Emily's boy.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>You mean Emily&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>No, no, my dear. Emily was married, left the stage. She wasn't happy. The
boy was her only comfort.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>He's my nephew. Why, I'm Uncle Nathaniel. Oh, Aunt Letty, I'm getting to be
an old man!</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Nathaniel, Jonathan doesn't know about his mother. I sent Susan away
because I didn't want her to associate these things with Jonathan's
mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>My God, Emily didn't do anything wrong.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Well, she was an actress.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>And a good one, too.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Yes, yes, dear. All that has been talked over many times, but John is the
head of the family and he doesn't approve of the stage.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>So! John is still himself.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>John is austere, Nathaniel. He is a Clay through and through and he holds
to the traditions of the family.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I remember the traditions, Aunt Letitia.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>I never oppose John. He feels that he is right. But it <i>is</i> very hard
sometimes to live up to his rules.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Has he rules?</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Well, he has ideas, dear&mdash;much like your father's. We might call them
rules.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Where is Emily?</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Two years ago, Nathaniel.</p>

<p>[<i>There is a moment's silence.</i></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Did she ever go back to the stage?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>No. John forbade it.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>And John is still forbidding.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>John is the head of the family.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>So.... The Clay family is still an absolute monarchy.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Nathaniel, dear, will you promise me&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL (<i>with a smile</i>)</p>

<p>I'll try.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Will you promise not to antagonize John?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Will John antagonize <i>me</i>? I came back to see my home&mdash;to see you, my dear
aunt. But I am a grown man now.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Won't you try to be patient? It will be pleasanter for me. And I have
waited so long to see you, Nathaniel. There are seventeen very, very long
years for us to talk about. Let John have his way.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Well, I'll try for a few days. But I give you warning, my ideas have been
settling during the past few years, too.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Remember, he is used to being obeyed just as your father was.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Yes, I remember that, dear Aunt; but John isn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> my father. He is just a
brother to whom fate gave a fifteen years' start by birth.</p>

<p>[<i>As a voice calls</i>, "Nathaniel, are you up there?" <i>Nathaniel looks at
Letitia.</i></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>His voice is just the same. (<i>Calling</i>) Yes, John, I am up here.</p>

<p>[<i>The antagonism between the two brothers is apparent immediately.</i></p>

<p><i>John Clay enters. He is an austere, pompous man of fifty who has the
softness of the tithe-collector and the hardness of the tax-collector. He
speaks with an adamantine finality which is destined to rude shattering.</i></p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>How do you do, Nathaniel?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I am very well, I thank you, John. How are you?</p>

<p>[<i>They shake hands perfunctorily.</i></p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>You arrived ahead of time.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>We haven't met for seventeen years.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>No. I've been away, John.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Where have you been?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I shall be here for two weeks, John, and if I should tell you all about
myself today, I should have nothing to talk about tomorrow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JOHN (<i>severely</i>)</p>

<p>You haven't changed, Nathaniel. You are still frivolous.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I shall be serious when I am your age, brother.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>I came out here to ask you to be very careful of your conversation before
the children.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>The children?</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Yes, my two grandchildren.&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Grandchildren! My, that makes me a great uncle. I <i>am</i> getting old, Aunt
Letitia!</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>I do not care to have them or Jonathan hear about any revolutionary or
other unusual ideas.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I shall try not to contaminate the children and Jonathan. How old are the
children?</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Mary is four and John 3rd is two.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I shall try to spare their sensibilities.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>They may not understand you but they will hear.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL (<i>to Letitia</i>)</p>

<p>How old is Jonathan?</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Fourteen.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>The impressionable age.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>The silly age.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Brother John, no age is the silly age. Fourteen is the age of visions and
enchantments and fears. What a boy of fourteen sees and hears takes on a
value that we cannot underestimate. Most men are defeated in life between
fourteen and twenty. At fourteen a boy begins to make a lens through which
he sees life. He thinks about everything. Ambition is beginning to stir in
him and he begins to know why he likes things, why he wants to do certain
things. He formulates lasting plans for the future and he takes in
impressions that are indelible. Things that seem nothing to old people
become memories to him that affect his whole life. The memory of a smile
may encourage him to surmount all obstacles and the memory of a bitterness
may act as an eternal barrier.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Nathaniel, are you a father?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>No, John, I am only a bachelor who is very much in love with life in
general and one lady in particular.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>You can know nothing of children, then.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I remember myself. Most men forget their younger selves and that is fatal.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>One would think to hear you talk that the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> important things in life
were a boy of fourteen and his moorings.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>One might know it.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>You are still the same impractical theorist.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I am the same theorist&mdash;a little older, a little more travelled. The
trouble with you, John, is that you think no age is important except your
own. You always thought that, even when you were fourteen. Oh, I know I
wasn't born then, but I know you.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Did you come back to your home in order to lecture me?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>No, no, I beg your pardon. I came back to see my home and Aunt Letitia and
the children&mdash;and you, and I&mdash;I think&mdash;Jonathan.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Nathaniel, when your letter came telling me that you had decided to come
back to see us, I was going to ask you not to come&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I gave no address.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>But on second thought, I made up my mind to forgive you&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>To let bygones be bygones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>That is the better way, brother: let the dead past bury its dead.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Why did you run away from home?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Because we couldn't agree, John.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>I was older than you; my judgment was mature; I was the head of the family,
in my father's place.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>We didn't speak the same language. I wanted something out of life that you
couldn't understand; that my father couldn't understand. I determined to
get it by myself.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>And so, I ran away.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Leaving no trace, no word.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Oh, yes, I left a very important word&mdash;"Good-bye."</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>You were willing to leave all the work of our father's business on my
shoulders.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>You were willing to take it all. And I wanted my freedom.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>You were selfish and heartless.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Selfish? Because I had my life to live and meant to live it?</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>You should have told us where you were living.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I preferred to work out my salvation alone, without interference. My going
away gave you a free hand. John, don't tell me that you were not overjoyed
that my flight gave you all my father's fortune.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>It was my duty as head of the family to protect you.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I didn't ask for protection. I wanted understanding.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>A boy of eighteen must not be allowed freedom.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Perhaps not, John, but he must be allowed to grow toward his goal. Eighteen
is not too young for a man to fly through the air in defense of his
country, or you. The burden of the world today is on the shoulders of men
from eighteen to eighty, share and share alike.... I wanted to be a
writer&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>And our brother Henry wanted to be a musical composer and our sister Emily
wanted to be an actress! A fine putout for the leading commercial family of
this state!</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Well, John, our brother and our sister have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> paid the final penalty. They
have died. Henry left a handful of worthless little tunes and Emily left a
trunkful of costumes as monuments to their folly. And now Emily's boy is
here under your wing.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>He's a dreamer like all the rest of you.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL (<i>with interest; tenderly</i>)</p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>He spends all his leisure time playing with that fool toy there.</p>

<p>[<i>He points to the model theatre.</i></p>

<p><i>Nathaniel smiles and crosses to the piano and lifts the cloth that covers
the theatre; then he looks at the placard and laughs joyously.</i></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>"Zenobia." " Alexander Jefferson, Sr."</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>He pretends that's his name&mdash;Alexander Jefferson, Sr!</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>People like to have other names. Look at all artists&mdash;like writers,
pugilists, and actors, and base ball players. And the Sr. Is an effort to
appear older.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Well, I'm breaking him of all that nonsense. I allow him only a certain
number of hours for play. Emily used to spoil him and it's been a task to
conquer him.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Jonathan is fourteen. When I was fourteen&mdash;What are Jonathan's tastes?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>He reads all the time and he wants to write plays and poetry; but I am
conquering that silliness.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I think I am going to like my nephew. John, I'll come into the house
shortly. I think I'll look at this toy a moment and I'll get Aunt Letitia
to show me some of Emily's things. A mere matter of sentiment.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Now don't put any foolishness into the boy's head.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I promise you I sha'n't try to change the boy's head, brother.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>I play golf from five to six.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Oh, you've taken up athletics?</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>The doctor's advice. Will you join me?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Thank you, no.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Very well. I'll see you at dinner.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Thank you. (<i>John goes out. Nathaniel looks musingly at Letitia who has
been sitting silently on Emily's trunk, knitting, Nathaniel crosses to her
and sits on a stool at her feet</i>) Does John always talk to you so much,
little church mouse?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>I have been a poor relation for thirty-five years, my boy, and to be a
successful poor relation, one must learn the art of silence.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>No wonder I ran away!</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>But you should have written to me.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Perhaps&mdash;I should&mdash;yes&mdash;I should have written, but I didn't. You see, Aunt
Letty, I was a sensitive boy. All my life I had dreamed of doing my own
work. I saw Henry disappointed in life, I saw Emily made miserable enough
through the traditions of the family. John couldn't understand me and I
couldn't understand him. There was no common meeting-ground. John was the
head of the family and so deeply was the idea of submission to rule
ingrained in me that I could think of only one way out of my restraint. I
wouldn't study engineering, and I wouldn't continue at Somerset School.
Well, I ran away from my ancestral castle to find my way in a new world. I
think I have found it.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Jonathan doesn't want to study engineering, either.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL (<i>Looks closely at her a moment and then smiles</i>)</p>

<p>As Ibsen would say&mdash;Ghosts! (<i>He walks toward the window</i>) Poor John!</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Poor Jonathan!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>[<i>At this moment Jonathan enters the room. He is a slender boy of fourteen
with a deep problem in his eyes. When he smiles before his elders, which is
seldom, he seems always prepared to restrain the smile. His voice is just
changing and this adds to his reticence. He has a tremendous capacity for
expressing wonderment and, as usual with one of his type, he is capable of
great displays of temper. He gives the impression of thinking about
everything he sees. He is at the age of wonder and only custom prevents the
world from becoming the promised land of visions and enchantments.</i></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Poor Jonathan!</p>

<p>[<i>He turns and sees the boy.</i></p>

<p><i>The two stand face to face for a moment. For Nathaniel it is the first
moment of a new relationship. For Jonathan it is a moment of uncertainty.

relative.</i></p>

<p><i>Jonathan looks first at Letitia, then at Nathaniel and then at Letitia.</i></p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Jonathan, this is your Uncle Nathaniel. Nathaniel, this is Emily's boy.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL (<i>Holds out his hand which Jonathan takes very shyly</i>)</p>

<p>Jonathan!</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>How do you do, sir?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>How tall you are!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN (<i>quite conscious of his short trousers</i>)</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I didn't take you away from any studies, did I?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>No, sir.... I was just writing something when Susan called me.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>May I ask what you were writing?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes, sir....</p>

<p>[<i>He swallows.</i></p>

<p>... A play.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>A play! <i>Zenobia</i>?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN (<i>Looks quickly for some indication of laughter in Nathaniel's
eyes</i>)</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>It's a tragedy, isn't it?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>In ten acts.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>There may be only eight.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Then I know who you are! (<i>Jonathan looks at him in surprise</i>) You are the
celebrated dramatist, Alexander Jefferson, Sr.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Did Aunt Letitia tell you?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>No, sir. I read it on the billboards. (<i>Jonathan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> laughs with a catch in
his breath</i>) And I should like to attend a performance, Mr. Jefferson.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>It isn't finished yet.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Well, when am I to see this theatre?</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Your Uncle Nathaniel and I shall come together.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>You've seen all the plays.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>That doesn't make any difference. I'd like to see them again.</p>

<p>[<i>Jonathan looks at her to be sure she is in earnest. Then he smiles.</i></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I'll finish <i>Zenobia</i> for tomorrow.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Agreed! Can you get the scenery ready?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I painted it last week.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>You must have the orchestra, too, Jonathan.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes, ma'am. Susan has some new pieces.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Is Susan the orchestra?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>What else have you written?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>A lot of plays, sir. Mother and I used to write little plays. I don't write
many any more.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I'm getting too big.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Do you ever write anything beside plays?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>That's splendid. Stories?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes, sir.... And I've written some po&mdash;poetry.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Excellent!</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>They're not very good, but Susan always wants me to write the poetry for
the music.</p>

<p>[<i>Aunt Letitia has repacked the trunk and locked it. She sees that

<p>I'll go to the house now and you can talk to Jonathan, Nathaniel.</p>

<p><i>Jonathan and Nathaniel look at each other for an embarrassed minute, then

<p>May I see some of your plays?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Do you really want to see them?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>[<i>Jonathan goes to a box on the piano in which there are many manuscripts
carefully bound. He hands one to Nathaniel.</i></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Here is one that mother and I wrote. She loved the theatre.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL (<i>taking the strange-looking little manuscript.</i> <i>Reading</i>:)</p>

<p>"Robin Hood and His Merry Men."</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>We used to make all those old stories into plays.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Do you like to write?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Oh, yes. I wish I could write real plays, but there's no one to help me
now. My mother used to correct them and tell me what was wrong. She knew a
lot about the theatre and she used to tell me all sorts of things. But now
Aunt Letitia doesn't say anything. Sometimes she comes to a show, but she
can't help me. And Uncle John doesn't like the theatre. He thinks I'm too
old to give shows, but I can't help it. There's nothing I like so much.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>May I read this some time?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes, sir.... Would you like to see it played?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I want to see them all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Forty-one of them?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Forty-one of them! Where do you keep them all?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Here in this box.</p>

<p>[<i>He shows all the manuscripts.</i></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>What are the pink ones?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Those are the ones mother liked best and these&mdash;(<i>showing blue ones</i>) are
the ones I liked best.... I like them all now, but it used to be lots of
fun to choose our favorites.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>What is this one that's different from all the rest?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>That's one that mother wrote all by herself. It's best of all.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>You must save these carefully, Jonathan&mdash;all your life.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Oh, yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Some day you may be proud of them.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>See&mdash;she wrote this, and I wrote this. I was a bad writer, wasn't I?</p>

<p>You mean what do I want to be?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I want to write plays.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Is that all?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Well, I'd like to run a theatre.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>What else?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I'd&mdash;you won't tell anyone, will you?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>You see, Uncle John wants me to go to Somerset School to study engineering
and learn the business.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>And you don't want to&mdash;Is that it?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I'd rather be a writer.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>They say you can't make any money at writing.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>That's what Uncle John says, but I want to just the same.</p>

<p>I'd rather be poor. What would you do, Uncle Nathaniel?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I&mdash;why I'd&mdash;Oh, come now, Jonathan&mdash;you know John is the head of the Clay

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Wouldn't you want to be what you want to be?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Perhaps I should.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I don't see how anyone can decide what you want to be&mdash;no matter how old he
is.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Have you ever talked to John?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Oh, yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>What did he say?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Don't tell anybody.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I won't. That's pretty far from engineering, isn't it?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes, sir. But everybody can't be alike. You and Uncle John aren't anything
alike.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>And we're brothers, too.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Do you ever get all mixed up and don't know what to do?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Oh, yes. I think everybody does.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>What do you do then?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I do something very silly.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Do you do silly things, too?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Yes. I'm afraid I do.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>What do you do when you get all mixed up?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I'll tell you&mdash;it might not work with everybody, you know&mdash;but it works
with me.</p>

<p>Yes, sir!</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>My mother used to sing me a song called&mdash;"There is a green hill far away."
I always liked that song because it gave me a feeling of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> contentment and
happiness. I imagined that I could see that hill with its pleasant green
slopes and at its foot lay a little cottage all cool and pleasant and open
to the winds. There were no locks and bolts to keep one out or to keep one
in. I used to imagine that I was climbing that hill to the top of the world
and when I reached the summit I could see&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN (<i>enthralled</i>)</p>

<p>I know&mdash;the whole wide world.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Its very bigness made me happy in my imagination.... Then when I grew up
and heavy troubles came to me I remembered the Green Hill Far Away and one
day I found such a hill and I climbed it&mdash;clear to the top&mdash;and there below
me lay the world&mdash;the whole wide world&mdash;and I told the world something then
and felt the better for it.... Jonathan, there is nothing like a hilltop to
make a man feel worth while.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I know what you mean.... But I always want to jump when I look down from
any place, do you?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I suppose everybody does.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Uncle John thinks every boy ought to be alike.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Many schools used to think that way.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>But boys don't all think the same. They're different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> just like men, only
they don't know so much.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Perhaps not.</p>

<p>Uncle John won't let me put on long pants until I'm fifteen.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>He let me put them on when I was fifteen, too.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Were you as tall as I am?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Just about the same height, but my legs were like pipe stems and I was very
much ashamed.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>So am I.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>You'll forget all about it after you're fifteen.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I can talk to you like I used to talk to my mother.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Thank you. We're going to be fine friends, aren't we?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>You bet. Is it silly for me to like to write plays?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Why do you ask that?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Because Uncle John says it's silly.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Well, it all depends upon the way you look at it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> Jonathan. The world has
never been able to agree as to what is and what is not silly. Mr. Browning,
the poet, might have considered hooks and eyes the silliest things in the
world; but to Mr. de Long, they were, no doubt, the most important things
in the world. Many men agree with Mr. Browning and many ladies agree with
Mr. de Long.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>That's what I think.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>You and I probably have many thoughts in common.</p>

<p>[<i>Susan and Mlle. Perrault enter. Mlle. Perrault is a Frenchwoman of

<p class="center">MLLE. PERRAULT</p>

<p>Ah, there you are, Mr. Nathaniel Clay. I met la belle Susanne in the
roadway and she told me you were in the lumber room in the carriage house
and I say to her, "We shall track him to his lair." Besides, I want to see
what a lumber room is.</p>

<p>I was hiding from you.</p>

<p class="center">MLLE. PERRAULT</p>

<p>Villain! And this is Jonathan. How do you do? Susanne tells me you write
poetry and she writes music and she promise me that you will sing for me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I can't sing.</p>

<p class="center">MLLE. PERRAULT</p>

<p>Ah! Susanne tell me you have a theatre and you write plays and paint
scenery and write poetry and sing songs and she say if I come here to the
lumber room in the carriage house you will play me a tragedy and sing me a
song.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Having introduced yourself to everybody, will you tell me, Susan, how Mlle.
Perrault learned so much in such a little time?</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Well, I was waiting for Jonathan to call me.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Oh, I forgot.</p>

<p class="center">MLLE. PERRAULT</p>

<p>She was sitting like a little fairy in the grass by the roadway, and I stop
my car and ask for Mr. Nathaniel Clay and she say you are here in the
lumber room in the carriage house and she tell me many things&mdash;because we
like each other very, very much and we walk very, very slowly.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Now! Now that you know all about Miss Susan Sample and Mr. Jonathan&mdash;(<i>He
realizes he doesn't know Jonathan's second name</i>) I think I shall introduce
you by your pen name, Jonathan&mdash;Mr. Alexander Jefferson, Sr.</p>

<p>(<i>To Mlle. Perrault</i>)</p>

<p>I am going to let them know about you. This,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> lady and gentleman, is Mlle.
Marthe Perrault of Paris, France. Mlle. Perrault, may I present my friend
Susan and my nephew Jonathan?</p>

<p class="center">MLLE. PERRAULT (<i>falling into the mood</i>)</p>

<p>I am very, very pleased to see you again, Miss Sample. It is a great
pleasure to have the honor of meeting you, Mr. Alexander Jefferson, Sr. I
am looking forward to the premi&egrave;re of your great tragedy, <i>Zenobia</i>, of
which Miss Sample has been telling me.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN (<i>Puts her arms about Mlle. Perrault and Jonathan is uncertain

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I think I'll tell you two a secret. (<i>Susan pricks up her ears</i>) Do you
like secrets?</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>And can you keep them?</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Oh, yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Well, some day Mlle. Perrault is going to be my wife.</p>

<p>[<i>He kisses Mlle. Perrault's hand.</i></p>

<p><i>Mlle. Perrault shows her engagement ring.</i></p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>When?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Very soon. She is here on some war work and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> when she and her father go
back to France I shall follow and we shall be married.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Now you mustn't tell.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Honest.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>No, sir!</p>

<p class="center">MLLE. PERRAULT</p>

<p>Now, we have a secret. And you are going to sing me a little song.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Come on, Jonathan. Let's do the new one.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Well, I'll try.</p>

<p>[<i>He is quite miserable with stage-fright.</i></p>

<p><i>Jonathan is left alone in his joy</i>. <i>As he stands,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> a strange, aimless,
vacuous whistling is heard outside the window an though from one ambling

alternately whistling and singing "All on a summer's day."</i></p>

<p><i>Presently the whistling of the strange air is heard as though coming from
downstairs. It stops and a voice calls out</i> "Hi!"</p>

<p>[<i>By this time the Voice has become a person in the shape of Hank, one of
the scum of creation who asks nothing of life and gives nothing. He was
born of woman and he grew into man's form, but one looking at him wonders
how he survived dirt and the mere effort of breathing. He is stoutish with
no marked coloring unless it be a cross between khaki and field-gray.
Weather and time have conspired to render him inconspicuous. When he speaks
his voice is produced with a careful effort to conserve energy. When he
walks it seems to be a movement in answer to prayer rather than a physical
fact.</i></p>

<p>What'd you do?</p>

<p>I went away.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Why didn't you try to work?</p>

<p class="center">HANK</p>

<p>Couldn't find nothing suitable. 'T first I felt sort o' worried an' then I
kep' walkin' on and I seen so much trouble where I went I says to myself,
"Hank, you're lucky," I says. "You ain't got no fam'ly to bother you an'
you ain't got nothing to worry you an' you don't have to get no place in
partic'lar and you don't have to stay no place." A man wot's got a wife's
all the time worrying about her health or her money spendin' or her gaddin'
or her naggin'. An' a man w'ots got a fam'ly's always wondering where
they'll end. An' a man's wot's got a home's all time worrying about keepin'
it locked up. I bet the poor nut wot owns this place can't breathe easy for
bein' scared things'll be took or burnt up. W'y you&mdash;look at
you&mdash;(<i>Whistles</i>) You're wishin' I'd go 'cause you're 'fraid I'll take
somethin'. I won't take nothin', young feller, 'cause I don't need nothin'
now and I won't need nothin' till it's cold again&mdash;and then I'll git an
overcoat maybe. It's too much trouble takin' things&mdash;'cause you have to
carry 'em. (<i>Whistles</i>) You goin' to let me sleep here some place?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I can't. My uncle would drive you away. Maybe he'd have you arrested.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HANK</p>

<p>I ain't done nothin'. I ain't hurtin' nobody.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Well, he doesn't allow strangers around.</p>

<p>That's where I went by jus' now.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I heard you whistling.</p>

<p class="center">HANK</p>

<p>That's a tune I made up once. (<i>Whistles</i>)</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Do you make up tunes?</p>

<p class="center">HANK</p>

<p>That's the only one I ever done. It comes in handy and it don't hurt no
one.</p>

<p>[<i>Jonathan unconsciously tries to whistle a phrase of the tune.</i></p>

<p>That's it. Say, what you got these bars for? It's like jail. Are they
afraid you'll jump out on them rocks?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>No, I guess not. There isn't much danger of my wanting to jump out.</p>

<p>Now, Jonathan, what do you mean by bringing such people into this place?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I didn't bring him in. He came up while I was working.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Do you call that silly stuff <i>working</i>?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I was getting it ready for Uncle Nathaniel.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>He's been putting that nonsense in your head, has he?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>He asked me to let him see all my plays.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>I suppose he told you to ask that dirty tramp in here.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>No, sir. He didn't see the tramp.</p>

<p>[<i>Hank is heard whistling.</i></p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>We'll see about that.</p>

<p>[<i>Hank whistles.</i></p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Jonathan, I won't have you waste your time on this stuff. I've been pretty
lenient with you and I've allowed you to keep your toys because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> Emily
spoiled you; but you're too big for such things and I'm going to put my
foot down right now. I'm not going to have this silly stuff around.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Uncle Nathaniel doesn't think it's silly.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>I'll decide what is and is not good for you.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>The same thing isn't good for everybody.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Don't talk back to me, young man.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I've got a right to think.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Jonathan!</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>If my mother was living, she wouldn't call everything I like to do silly.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Your mother didn't know what was good for you.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>My mother was the best woman in the world.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>That will do, Jonathan. Your mother was my sister and I am not saying
anything against her. But I do say that stuff must go.</p>

<p>[<i>He starts for the door.</i></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>[<i>John walks over to the theatre and sweeps the whole structure onto the

<p>Now.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>You dirty coward, you&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>John turns upon the boy and strikes him across the face.</i></p>

<p><i>In mingled rage and humiliation Jonathan sobs wildly once or twice, then
controls himself and glares violently at his uncle.</i></p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>I'll let you think about it. I'll leave you here with your toys like a
girl-baby.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes out the door, closing it and turning the key in the lock.</i></p>

<p><i>Jonathan runs to the door.</i></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>You let me out of here! You let me out of here!</p>

<p>[<i>He pounds the door with his fists.</i></p>

<p><i>Then he turns in despair and humiliation.</i></p>

<p><i>He paces the floor a moment, not knowing what to do. Suddenly Hank's
whistle is heard. The boy listens as though fascinated and goes to the
window and watches Hank. Jonathan goes to his wrecked theatre and, taking
it up, piles his manuscripts, the pink and the blue, on it. He hesitates to
include one in the pile, offering once or twice to put it in his pocket,
but he finally places it in grim determination with the others. Then he
takes it off and stuffs it in his pocket. He stuffs the pile in the stove
and sets a match to it, watches it a moment, then writes on a piece of
paper, fastens it to the door. Then he finds a piece of rope on a packing
case,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> moves the ladder under the gable window, fastens the rope to a peg
in the wall, climbs the ladder, considers a moment, returns to the stove
with the beloved manuscript, stuffs it in the fire, remounts the ladder and
lets his weight onto the rope. As he disappears from view, the rope breaks
and a cry and sound of falling are heard.</i></p>

<p><i>The flames from the burning theatre and manuscripts flicker against the
wall for a silent moment.</i></p>

six years you squeal about what you done.... Your Uncle John swatted you
and you burned your theatre things and jumped out o' the window and broke
your back and I saved you....</p>

<p>Go ahead.... I'll wait for you.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>And I'd like to give a show. You know, Hank, I used to want to be an
actor....</p>

<p class="center">HANK</p>

<p>Sure, all kids want to be actors or go in a circus or do something where a
lot o' people are lookin' on.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>But I can't be an actor now, because nobody'd want to look at me.</p>

<p class="center">HANK</p>

<p>You act like that hump's ruined your life, when all you got to do's crouch
over a little more and look sad and you can get anything you want. Why,
it's money in your pocket, that's what that hump is; it's money in your
pocket.</p>

its foot stands a little cottage, all cool and pleasant with great glass

<p>Would you let him come back home?</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>No. When he ran away, I cast him out forever.</p>

<p>Couldn't you forgive him if he was very, very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> sorry for what he had

<p>Will you play for me?</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Oh, yes.... What shall I play?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Anything.</p>

<p>[<i>Jonathan notices his dirty hands.</i></p>

<p>Excuse me a moment.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes to a bird-bath and washes his hands, wipes them and returns to
the piano.</i></p>

<p><i>Susan plays a bit of a nocturne with ease and grace.</i></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Do you remember this?</p>

<p>[<i>He hums "All on a Summer Day."</i></p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Oh, yes.</p>

<p>[<i>She plays the tune in a sophisticated musical way, but Jonathan is
disappointed.</i></p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>You don't like it?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>That isn't exactly the way it goes.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Oh, yes, it is.</p>

<p>[<i>She plays it once more and sings it.</i></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>No&mdash;no&mdash;no. It ought to go this way.</p>

<p>[<i>He sings it as he had sung it years before.</i></p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>You sing that just as Jonathan used to sing it.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I like it that way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Did Jonathan teach it to you?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes.... A long time ago.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Did he tell you&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>About the lovely lady who danced to the tune? Oh, she was wonderful!</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Jonathan ran away&mdash;and he never wrote to me or thought of me.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>He thought of you and he talked of you and he sang of you.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>No.... I can't believe that.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Jonathan loves you very much.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>If a man loves a woman very much he can't go away from her for years and
years.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Suppose Jonathan had pride and was ashamed to let you know that he had
failed.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Jonathan wouldn't fail. I know Jonathan.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>He&mdash;Susan Sample!</p>

<p>[<i>Susan plays softly. She is lovely in the sunlight which is lengthening
across the lawn.</i></p>

<p>[<i>Jonathan watches her quietly. The love of the boy fans into flame and he
reaches out to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> her, then in the consciousness of his deformity he turns
away.</i></p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Will you tell me where Jonathan was when you last saw him?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I don't know&mdash;The last time I saw Jonathan&mdash;he was tall and straight&mdash;and
making his way.</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Oh, well.</p>

<p>[<i>Albert Peet enters. He is a little man of immaculate appearance and great

<p>Oh... and this is his friend? How do you do?</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Do you remember this? I used to play it for you.</p>

<p>[<i>She begins "All on a Summer's Day."</i></p>

<p class="center">ALBERT (<i>laughing</i>)</p>

<p class="center">SUSAN (<i>to Jonathan</i>)</p>

<p class="center">ALBERT (<i>looking at his watch)</i></p>

<p>Well, all this is very pleasant indeed, but we'll have to go, Susan dear.</p>

<p>[<i>At the "Susan, dear" Jonathan turns quickly and sees the two holding
hands. Susan holds up her left hand and shows an engagement ring on it.
Jonathan is utterly crushed.</i></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I think I'd better say good-bye.</p>

<p>[<i>He takes up his cap.</i></p>

<p class="center">SUSAN</p>

<p>Good-bye. If you see Jonathan, tell him I'm going to marry Albert Peet.
He'll know.</p>

<p class="center">ALBERT</p>

<p>Good-bye.</p>

<p>[<i>Albert and Susan walk off happily in the sunshine.</i></p>

<p><i>Jonathan looks after them.</i></p>

<p><i>Mlle. Perrault enters followed by Mary and John 3rd. Mlle. Perrault's
dress is almost like the one she had worn when she first met Jonathan in
the lumber-room, except that the colors are reversed and more brilliant.
Mary is a lovely little yellow-haired child of ten and John 3rd is a
stoical matter-of-fact boy of eight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> The two children are evidently very
fond of Mlle. Perrault, as fond as Jonathan and Susan had seemed. If the
children seem thoughtless and cruel, it is because they are children and
life has not yet laid a hard hand upon them. The sun rays are very low
against the wall now so that anyone walking near it will cast a very heavy
shadow.</i></p>

<p class="center">MARY</p>

<p class="center">MLLE. PERRAULT</p>

<p>'Sh! Children.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I am well, I thank you.</p>

<p class="center">MLLE. PERRAULT</p>

<p>What are you doing here?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Oh, no.</p>

<p class="center">MLLE. PERRAULT</p>

<p>Where is your mother?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Where did she live?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN (<i>Looks for a trace of recognition</i>)</p>

<p class="center">MARY</p>

<p>Oh, please tell us.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Why?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>You see, I ran away from home&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">JOHN III</p>

<p>When you run away from home, you're no good.</p>

<p class="center">MARY</p>

<p>Now, John, that isn't always so.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN III</p>

<p>It is.</p>

<p class="center">MARY</p>

<p>It isn't. Goldilocks and the Babes in the Wood and the Marquis of Carabas
were all good, and they ran away from home.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN III</p>

<p>But they had bad homes.</p>

<p class="center">MARY</p>

<p>Was your home bad?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I thought it was.</p>

<p>You thought it was. But was it?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="center">MLLE. PERRAULT</p>

<p>Oh, John.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN III</p>

<p>No, he isn't. Grandfather said nobody who ran away from home was any good!</p>

<p class="center">MARY</p>

<p>Why did you run away from home?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I mustn't tell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">MARY</p>

<p>Oh, you won't tell anything!</p>

<p class="center">JOHN III (<i>pointing to Hank</i>)</p>

<p>What did you say <i>he</i> was, Ma'mselle?</p>

<p class="center">MLLE. PERRAULT</p>

<p>What do you know about Jonathan?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I knew him once&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">MLLE. PERRAULT</p>

<p>He was a splendid little man! He could make such lovely songs.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Do you remember the one he and Susan Sample made up?</p>

<p class="center">MLLE. PERRAULT</p>

<p>Let's see&mdash;how did it go?</p>

<p>[<i>Hums a little&mdash;tries several folk tunes. The children edge up to Jonathan
during this and manage to touch his back several times, each keeping count.
Jonathan smiles at them, thinking it's attention.</i></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>No, it went this way.</p>

<p>[<i>He sings a little of the song and Mlle. Perrault joins him. As he stops
singing she switches the time to waltz time and begins to sway to it. The
music is taken up as by a dream-orchestra and Mlle. Perrault dances a very
lovely little waltz.</i></p>

<p class="center">JOHN III</p>

<p>Oh, look at your shadow!</p>

<p>[<i>Mlle. Perrault turns and sees her shadow on the wall.</i></p>

<p>I can make a bigger one than that.</p>

<p class="center">MARY</p>

<p>Oh, come on, ma'mselle, let's all make shadows.</p>

<p>[<i>The three of them stand in front of the wall.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JOHN III</p>

<p>Boy, you come, too.</p>

<p class="center">MLLE. PERRAULT</p>

<p>Come, boy.</p>

<p>[<i>Jonathan joins them standing so that his deformity doesn't show in the
shadow.</i></p>

<p>Now, let's dance&mdash;Give me your hand&mdash;so.</p>

<p>[<i>The four dance, while Mlle. Perrault hums "All on a Summer's Day." They
are having a very good time when Susan and Albert enter.</i></p>

<p><i>Jonathan is a little conscious of Susan and Albert, and he manages to make
several awkward moves.</i></p>

<p class="center">MLLE. PERRAULT</p>

<p>Now, let's make everybody's shadow dance by itself.</p>

<p class="center">MARY</p>

<p>You first, Mlle.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN III</p>

<p>I won't. I'm going to be next to last.... He's going to be last.</p>

<p>[<i>Mary makes a pretty "statue."</i></p>

<p class="center">MARY</p>

<p>Now, John&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>John III, holding a staff, stands bow-legged and pigeon-toed.</i></p>

<p class="center">JOHN III (<i>to Jonathan</i>)</p>

<p>[<i>Jonathan, still conscious of Susan, but more in the spirit of the game
nevertheless, laughs almost gleefully.</i></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>You just wait.</p>

<p>[<i>He stands in front of the wall and does some comical movements with his
feet and legs, then he turns in such a way that for the first time the
shadow of his hump is thrown into a pitiful distortion on the wall. He
doesn't see it at first, for he is lost in the game with the children.</i></p>

<p class="center">JOHN III (<i>yelling suddenly</i>)</p>

<p>Oh, look!</p>

<p>[<i>The children laugh immoderately, and Jonathan turns his head quickly, but

into the distorted picture.</i></p>

<p>That's funnier than mine.</p>

<p>Uncle Nathaniel.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I can't hear you.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>You&mdash;are&mdash;my&mdash;Uncle Nathaniel.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Come, come, my boy. I can't hear you.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Aren't you&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Nathaniel&mdash;Clay?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL (<i>kindly, but as to a stranger</i>)</p>

<p>Yes, I am Mr. Nathaniel Clay.</p>

<p>[<i>Jonathan smiles one of his old half smiles.</i></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>My name's&mdash;Jonathan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Jonathan!... I had a nephew whose name was Jonathan.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Don't you know me?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>You must forgive me, little man&mdash;but I do not remember you. Boys grow so
quickly.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Don't you remember <i>Zenobia</i>?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p><i>Zenobia?</i> Who was she?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Don't you remember the little theatre?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Oh, yes, my nephew Jonathan had a little toy theatre, and he wrote a play
called <i>Zenobia</i>.... He burnt them.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Was it wrong to burn them?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I don't know. You see Jonathan ran away, and I have never seen him since.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Do you blame him?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Well, I can't say. When a fine boy like Jonathan runs away from home, he
may have what he considers a good reason.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Don't you know why he ran away?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I think I know.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Would you tell me why?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>That wouldn't do any good, my boy.... If you had an uncle who liked you
very much, would you run away?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>No, sir&mdash;not if I had another chance....</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Don't you really know me?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I'm sorry&mdash;no!</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN (<i>pointing to Hank</i>)</p>

<p>Do you know him?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>That tramp?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes, sir.... That's Hank.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Hank?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes, the one I ran away with.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Did you run away, too?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes, sir; I jumped out the window, and I fell and broke my back. Hank
said&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>What a dirty man!</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>He's my pal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>You're evidently a fine young man inside.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Oh, I'm sorry, sir, that I ran away.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>You can't undo the past, my boy, but you can make the future.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I can't straighten my back.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Perhaps not, but you can straighten your life.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I'm only a beggar, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>There is something everybody can do.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>There isn't any place for me....</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>My boy, there is a place for everybody who wants a place.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Do you remember what your nephew wanted to do?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Yes, he wanted to write plays and run a theatre and be an actor.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I couldn't ever be an actor, could I?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>No, my boy.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Supposing you had your heart set on something and couldn't do it, what
would you do?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I'd not give up.... I'd try something else.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Supposing I were your nephew, what would you do?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I'd find out what you wanted to be.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Don't I look like Jonathan?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Jonathan must be very tall now.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>If Jonathan weren't tall?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>But he <i>is</i> tall and splendid. I know Jonathan! And he's doing what he set
out to do.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I hope you'll find him, sir, and I hope he'll make you proud.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL (<i>very earnestly</i>)</p>

<p>My boy, how old are you?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I'm twenty.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Twenty.... Will you try to pull yourself out of the rut?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>What do you mean, sir?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Look at that man. What is he to you?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>He's my pal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>You mustn't waste your life on such emptiness as his.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I'm going to try, sir.... And if I make good, will you believe I'm
Jonathan?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I'll believe you are you.... Here....</p>

<p>[<i>He offers Jonathan a coin.</i></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Oh, no, sir.... I can't&mdash;from you&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Well, you are a strange beggar&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I'm not a beggar at heart.... I don't want to be what I am. But I don't
know which way to turn. I'm all mixed up.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>All mixed up?</p>

<p>[<i>Nathaniel turns and looks toward the hill.</i></p>

<p>Boy, there is a green hill far away. Climb to the top of it, look about and
you will see&mdash;</p>

<p>I know: the whole wide world!</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Go to the hilltop alone&mdash;and cry out to your heart's content.&mdash;There's
nothing like a hilltop to make a man feel worth while!</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I knew that, sir; but I forgot it. I'm going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Good-bye, boy; God bless you.</p>

<p>[<i>The two clasp hands and Nathaniel goes.</i></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>He believes in me....</p>

<p>[<i>He watches Nathaniel with wide eyes, then calls to Hank.</i></p>

<p>Hank! Hank!</p>

<p class="center">HANK</p>

<p>[<i>Hank lies down.</i></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Uncle Nathaniel.... He just passed by.... But, Hank, he believed in me! He
believed I'd make good.</p>

<p class="center">HANK</p>

<p>Say, what's the matter with you today?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I'm goin' to leave you, Hank.</p>

<p class="center">HANK</p>

<p>Huh?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Old pal, I'm going to leave you forever. You've stuck by me&mdash;</p>

things. I heard voices of the past and the future. I wanted to tell what I

<h2>ACT III</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Jonathan Makes a Wish</span></h4>


<p>[<i>The scene is a summer house on the estate of John Clay. It is charmingly
furnished with wicker chairs and a table. The building is hexagon shape and
we look into half the hexagon. The doors at the left open on to the path
that leads from the house. The doors at the back open onto a garden path
that leads to a gate. Eight weeks have elapsed since the first act.</i></p>

<p><i>The curtain rises disclosing an empty stage. It is early evening and
sunset is leaving only the faintest tinge above the hills. After a moment
Jonathan enters. He is unchanged except that he still carries in his eyes
some of the horror of his delirium. He opens the back windows and then sits
above the table and begins to look at an illustrated paper.</i></p>

<p><i>Nathaniel enters carrying a manuscript. He seems a bit less carefree than
at his homecoming, and he also seems closer to Jonathan.</i></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Well, my boy&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Uncle Nathaniel, did you know that Caproni was an artist?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>You mean the Caproni who makes the wonderful aeroplanes?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>No, I didn't know it; but I'm not surprised.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Aren't these pictures fine?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Excellent.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>He made them.... They're like great dragon-flies, aren't they?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>A whole swarm of them.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>It must feel funny to fly through air.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Would you like to try it some time?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes... but I'd have to get used to it.... It must be like diving.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>When you were very ill you seemed to imagine you were falling.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Did I talk much when I was unconscious?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>You talked almost continuously.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Did I?... You said you'd tell me what I said&mdash;when I was strong enough....
I'm pretty strong now.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Do you know what I did?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I don't know.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL (<i>showing manuscript</i>)</p>

<p>Can you guess?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN (<i>Looks at manuscript</i>)</p>

<p>"Jonathan Builds a Fear." What does that mean?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>When you were delirious I listened to what you said and then I made a story
out of it.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>You mean this is all about me?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>It's about a little hunchback who thought he was you.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I know. I was always trying to make somebody know me, and finally I thought
I jumped from the top of a hill and I seemed to be falling for years and
years....</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Those were terrible days, my boy, and do you know, we were afraid you
wouldn't live.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>It was a terrible feeling.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I know, but all that's over now; and there's the whole story about the
little hunchback you never were.</p>

<p>[<i>Hank's whistle is heard. Jonathan rises very quickly and looks at

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>He comes every now and then to ask about you and to get something to eat.</p>

<p>[<i>Hank whistles again.</i></p>

<p class="center">HANK'S VOICE (<i>at back</i>)</p>

<p>Hi!</p>

<p>Come in, Hank.&mdash;</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>I'm well now. How are you?</p>

<p class="center">HANK</p>

<p>I'm beginning to get cold, so I think I'll go south tomorrow and I thought
I'd drop in to say good-bye.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I'll give you an overcoat, Hank.</p>

<p class="center">HANK</p>

<p>No, thanks. It's too hot to carry it. I'll get one when I really need it,
maybe.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Well, here's something for you.</p>

<p>[<i>He offers him a five dollar bill.</i></p>

<p>Five dollars! No, thanks. If I had that much money I'd lose it maybe. Give
me two bits and call it square.</p>

<p>[<i>Nathaniel hands him a quarter.</i></p>

<p>Thanks.... Well... good-bye.... I'm glad your back wasn't broke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Good-bye, Hank.</p>

<p class="center">HANK</p>

<p>Good-bye, Mister.... I'll see you next year maybe, when it's warm.&mdash;Say,
kid, I'd like to see that <i>Zenobia</i> show again:&mdash;"Hail, noble duke," "All's
well, Irene." "Not very well, noble duke."</p>

<p>[<i>He goes out, chuckling to himself.</i></p>

<p><i>Aunt Letitia enters. As usual she has something to keep her hands busy.
She seats herself comfortably in a chair that custom has evidently made her
very own. In her work she shows the effect of time upon her eyes and she
may feel a tiny draught that causes her to close the doors behind her and
draw her scarf a bit more closely about her. Never has Aunt Letitia seemed
more successfully the poor relation.</i></p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>I thought you were out with John.</p>

<p>I'm glad it isn't true.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes out.</i></p>

relieve him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Has John gone?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Only for a stroll&mdash;the doctor's orders.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Sit down.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>In John's chair?</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>If you wish.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>John's chair! The throne of the head of the family! (<i>He sits in John's
chair</i>) Well?</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Nathaniel dear, you are making John very unhappy.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>And John has made me very unhappy, dearest Aunt Letty.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>The feeling at the dinner table was almost unbearable tonight. There we sat
strained and silent.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I am sorry. I try to avoid meals with John as much as possible.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>You've been here eight weeks and John and I know nothing of you. For me it
is enough that you are here; but John is the head of the family<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> and he
feels that you ought to treat him with greater deference.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>It is revolting to me to have a tsar in the family.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Your father and your father's father and grandfather were rulers of the
Clay family.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I don't question that.</p>

<p>You can't change John.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I don't want to change John.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Then why not tell him something about yourself?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>It is none of John's affairs how or why I live. It is none of his affair
how or why or when I shall marry Mlle. Perrault.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Perhaps not.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>When I tell him anything, Aunt Letty, it will be one thing&mdash;I have stayed
here because I love Jonathan, because he needs me. And I have listened to
the boy's fears and to his hopes as they came out of his poor tortured
little soul in his delirium. I have watched him during his convalescence,
and I see in him a growing man in prison. John sees in him only the
potential head of the family; but he is my flesh and blood as much as he is
John's and I intend to set him free.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>My beloved Nathaniel, John will not give Jonathan up to you.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I don't want Jonathan unless he wants to come to me, but I do want
Jonathan's freedom.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Isn't he a bit young to have <i>freedom</i>.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Aunt Letitia, I don't mean a silly license.&mdash;I mean freedom. If you are
cultivating a peach-tree you don't expect oranges on it even if it could
wish to be an orange tree, but you can help to make it bear better peaches.
Jonathan isn't a mechanical business person. His bent is in another
direction.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>What are you going to do?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Frankly, I do not know.</p>

<p>[<i>Up to window.</i></p>

<p>All I know now is that I shall stay here until I find a plan.</p>

<p>[<i>Jonathan enters.</i></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Where is Uncle John?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>He has gone for a stroll.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>What do you want, my dear?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Uncle John sent word that he wanted to see me here at 7:30.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>[<i>Letitia and Nathaniel look at each other.</i></p>

<p><i>Jonathan takes out a large silver watch.</i></p>

<p>It's 7:29 now.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>John will be on time&mdash;count sixty slowly&mdash;</p>

<p>[<i>John enters. He is rather pale, seems pre-occupied and even more
unapproachable than ever.</i></p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Did you have a pleasant stroll?</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>I wasn't walking.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>I shall go into the house, I think.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>No, Aunt Letitia, I would rather you'd wait, if you please.</p>

<p>[<i>Nathaniel is an interested spectator. He cannot understand why Jonathan
should be present for what will probably be an eventful family scene.</i></p>

<p>Nathaniel, will you sit down?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Certainly.&mdash;Where?</p>

<p class="center">JOHN (<i>tartly</i>)</p>

<p>Would you like my chair?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>[<i>He sits in John's chair, much to John's annoyance.</i></p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Jonathan, sit down.</p>

<p>[<i>Jonathan sits. John also sits. Aunt Letitia knows what to expect.
Nathaniel is more curious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> than angry. Jonathan is attending his first
family conference.</i></p>

<p>Jonathan, I've sent for you because I want to talk to you seriously.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Do you think the boy is strong enough?</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>The doctor told me today that he would be quite equal to it.... Eight weeks
ago, Jonathan, you made an effort to run away from your home, because I
punished you. In your foolish defiance of all family authority you suffered
a fall that might have resulted in a lasting and serious injury.
Fortunately you have recovered fully from the result of your fall.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Excuse me, John, but all of us know this.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>One moment, please, Nathaniel.... I have now arranged that you begin your
preparation for your life work immediately. You will leave for Somerset
School the day after tomorrow.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN (<i>desperately</i>)</p>

<p>Uncle John, I don't want to go to Somerset School.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>You will leave for Somerset day after tomorrow. Good night, Jonathan.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Why Somerset?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Good night, Jonathan.</p>

<p>[<i>Jonathan, dazed, goes out.</i></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Jonathan will never go to Somerset School.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Nathaniel, you forfeited your rights in the family councils when you ran
away from home seventeen years ago.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>This boy will run away again and again and I mean to save him from what I
have suffered, if I can.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Nathaniel, by what right do you attempt to interfere with my decisions?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>By the right of blood and understanding.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Blood and understanding? Where were you when Emily had to leave her husband
and brought her boy into my home? Where were you when Emily died? I took
Emily in and I took her boy in. As head of the family it was my duty to do
so and as head of the family it is my duty to see that the boy is brought
up in the best traditions of the family.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>John, you can't force this boy into a mold.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>A boy of fourteen doesn't know his mind.... Do <i>you</i> know what Jonathan
wants to be?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Yes, a writer of plays, a theatre director, and an actor.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Imagine!... And I suppose you encouraged him.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>No, but I didn't discourage him. The selection was wide enough for him to
find some lasting life work.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>He never told me he wanted to be an actor.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Oh, my brother, every growing boy has a deep secret wish that he cannot
bring himself to disclose! As you know, I always wanted to be a writer, but
most of all I wanted to be a left-handed base ball pitcher. And although
I'm irretrievably right handed I used to practice&mdash;religiously&mdash;pitching
with my left hand.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>That was juvenile foolishness.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Yes, but it was genuine.</p>

<p>[<i>John starts to speak.</i></p>

<p>What am I now? I am going to tell you, John&mdash;by and by. First, we must
dispose of the boy.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>I shall decide about the boy.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>No, John; the boy must decide for himself.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>He'd decide to be an actor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>If he did, what of it?</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>I want members of my family to do useful work.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>What <i>is</i> useful work? An actor serves his purpose just as a plumber or
lawyer serves his.... The only difference is that all of us are not
plumbers or lawyers while all of us <i>are</i> actors. Yes, John, we're all
playing something&mdash;you are playing at head of the family, I'm&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Still I do not regard acting as a worth-while or lucrative profession.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>You never know, John.... Five generations ago the Clays were respectable
carpenters. They weren't wealthy and they gave no promise of becoming
wealthy. Then suddenly our revered ancestor became a successful maker of
cypress drain pipes&mdash;sewer pipes, I think we used to call them! The family
fortunes were founded!! Our ancestor bought a high hat and the esteem of
his neighbors. Cypress was in time replaced by pottery. Conduits for wires
and terra cotta building materials were added to our achievements and then
in your r&eacute;gime superfine sewers became a specialty.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Every kind of concrete work!</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I beg your pardon! Concrete sewers and other concrete things.&mdash;Such is the
foundation of the family.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>You are evidently ashamed of our business.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Not at all, but I cannot consider the manufacturing of sewers a greater
achievement than acting.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Nathaniel, are you an actor?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>What are you?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>For the present I am Jonathan's uncle.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>You have nothing to do with Jonathan.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>The boy is not going to Somerset School.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Nathaniel, I shall not tolerate your interference. Now I must ask you to
leave this house.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>John... Nathaniel... my boys, it isn't my way to interfere; but please for
my sake, for your mother's sake&mdash;think what you're doing.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN (<i>With some tenderness he lays his hand on Letitia's</i>)</p>

<p>I have thought, Aunt Letitia. I can not allow this boy's life to be ruined
as Emily's and Henry's and Nathaniel's were.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Ruined? John, I'll tell you how ruined my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> life has been and I'll tell you
in terms you'll understand. My income last year was over $350,000!</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Are you acting now?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Yes, I'm acting&mdash;I'm acting in terms that you will understand.... You know
that I'm your brother Nathaniel. Do you know who else I am? I am a writer
and a playwright and a director in the United Baking Company and a
stockholder in the National Munitions Company&mdash;munitions, John; think of
it, millions, millions in them&mdash;and I'm willing and eager to take Emily's
boy and educate him in the way he wants to live his life.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>What are these heroics?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I mean what I say. If need be I shall use brute force, financial force or
any kind of force to free Jonathan from the misery that I endured in this
house.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>You had everything you wanted.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Everything except freedom to think my own thoughts. John, some people are
like reinforced concrete. Someone builds the iron frame and the wooden
molds, then pours the cement and when it has hardened, the molds are
removed and lo, you have a monolith&mdash;a solid unchangeable stone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>You talk very well, Nathaniel, but I shall insist upon bringing up my
sister's child in my way.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Would you have him run away as I did?</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>He will never run away again. He has had his lesson.</p>

<p>[<i>Jonathan enters carrying a suit case.</i></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>May I speak to you, Uncle John?</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>What are you doing with that suit case?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I'm going away.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Who gave you permission?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Nobody.... I've been thinking since a little while ago and at first I
thought I'd run away again; but that wouldn't be quite fair&mdash;so I came to
tell you.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Take that suit case back into the house.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>No, sir! I'm going and nobody can keep me here unless they tie me.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Well, I'll tell you one thing&mdash;if you leave this house without my
permission I'll cut you off without a penny and you'll never be allowed to
come back again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes, sir. I know that; but I'm going and I came to tell you good-bye.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Very well. You've made your choice&mdash;and I never want to see you again as
long as you live. Good-bye, Jonathan. Good-bye, Nathaniel.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>John, don't say things you'll regret. Jonathan doesn't mean what he's
saying.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes'm, I do mean what I say.</p>

<p class="center">JOHN</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>[<i>He goes out.</i></p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>Boys, you are so hot-headed&mdash;so much alike....</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>You dear, you have always been content to compromise while we two must go
our own ways or not at all. You go to John. Help him as you can. He's not a
bad man&mdash;he's just a structure of reinforced concrete. You love John and he
in his way loves you. Go to John and comfort his outraged authority.</p>

<p class="center">LETITIA</p>

<p>I'm sorry things have turned out this way. (<i>She kisses them</i>) Good night,
my dears. Wait until morning if you can, my darling Nathaniel.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I couldn't help it.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>What are you going to do?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I don't know.... They say there's plenty of work on farms.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>You can't write if you work on a farm.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I can earn some more money and save. Other boys have worked their way
through school and college. I can do that.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Of course&mdash;that is a way out of it. Yes... of course....</p>

<p>[<i>Nathaniel opens the back doors and sees the thinnest crescent moon

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>More than anything?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>More than being a writer or a theatre director or an actor?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Oh, yes, I'm too young to start right away. I have to have an education
first.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Suppose that wish couldn't be, then what would you wish?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>That you'd write me long letters and let me write you long letters.</p>

<p>[<i>Takes up his suit case.</i></p>

<p>I'd better be going now.</p>

<p>Aren't you going to tell John and Aunt Letitia good-bye?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>No, sir. I don't think I'd better. Uncle John doesn't care and Aunt Letitia

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Do you like me that much?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I like you more than that much. You'll get some long trousers and we'll
plan and plan. Suppose we run away together.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Do you think we ought to leave some word, Uncle Nathaniel?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Of course. How stupid of me.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Oh!</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL (<i>taking up paper</i>)</p>

<p>The message ought to be short.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Why did you run away?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I wanted to write.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>You did!</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Didn't you know I ran away?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>No, sir; they never would tell me what became of you.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>They didn't know.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>How could you keep it from them?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I changed my name&mdash;Mr. Alexander Jefferson, Sr! What shall I say?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I can't think.... Did Uncle John lock you in?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>No, I just ran away.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>How long did it take you to make up your mind to go?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I thought about it first when I was twelve. My father was still living
then.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Did you go to Somerset School?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;for three years.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>What did you do after you ran away?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>I had a very hard time, my boy&mdash;at first. I worked at anything I could get,
then I got into a newspaper office, then I wrote "autobiographies" of
famous men.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I thought you had to write your own autobiography&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Not nowadays. Then I wrote some successful short stories, then some very
successful long ones&mdash;and now I am independent; but it took me ten bitter
years to make my first success.... What shall I write here?</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>I never could think of things to say when I was going away.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL</p>

<p>Neither could I.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN</p>

<p>Don't you think "good-bye" would be enough?</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL (<i>writing</i>)</p>

<p>Capital.... "Good-Bye&mdash;Nathaniel." Now you sign it.</p>

<p class="center">JONATHAN (<i>Signs</i>)</p>

<p>"Jonathan."... Maybe we ought to put a line under it so Aunt Letitia won't
feel so bad.</p>

<p class="center">NATHANIEL (<i>makes a line</i>)</p>

<p>Dear Aunt Letitia will understand. She is the blessed kind who always does.
Now, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> shall we put it?... On John's chair, and maybe he'll understand
too.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>An Anthology of Dramatic Theory and Criticism from
Aristotle to the Present Day, in a Series of Selected
Texts, with Commentaries, Biographies and
Bibliographies</i></p>

<p class="center">By BARRETT H. CLARK</p>

<p><i>Author of</i> "Contemporary French Dramatists," "The
Continental Drama of Today," "British and American
Drama of Today," etc., etc.</p></div>

<p>A book of paramount importance. This monumental anthology brings together
for the first time the epoch-making theories and criticisms of the drama
which have affected our civilization from the beginnings in Greece down to
the present day. Beginning with Aristotle, each utterance on the subject
has been chosen with reference to its importance, and its effect on
subsequent dramatic writing. The texts alone would be of great interest and
value, but the author, Barrett H. Clark, has so connected each period by
means of inter-chapters that his comments taken as a whole constitute a
veritable history of dramatic criticism, in which each text bears out his
statements.</p>

<p>Nowhere else is so important a body of doctrine on the subject of the drama
to be obtained. It cannot fail to appeal to any one who is interested in
the theater, and will be indispensable to students.</p>

<p>The introduction to each section of the book is followed by an exhaustive
bibliography; each writer whose work is represented is made the subject of
a brief biography, and the entire volume is rendered doubly valuable by the
index, which is worked out in great detail.</p>

<p><i><b>Prof. Brander Matthews</b></i> of Columbia University says: "Mr. Clark deserves
high praise for the careful thoroughness with which he has performed the
task he set for himself. He has done well what was well worth doing. In
these five hundred pages he has extracted the essence of several five-foot
shelves. His anthology will be invaluable to all students of the principles
of playmaking; and it ought to be welcomed by all those whose curiosity has
been aroused by the frequent references of our latter day theorists of the
theater to their predecessors."</p>

<p><i><b>Wm. Lyon Phelps</b></i> of Yale University writes: "Mr. Clark's book, 'European
Theories of the Drama,' is an exceedingly valuable work and ought to be
widely useful."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Leaves from a Critic's Scrapbook</span></p>

<p class="center">BY WALTER PRICHARD EATON PREFACE BY BARRETT H. CLARK</p>

<p>A new volume of criticisms of plays and papers on acting, playmaking, and
other dramatic problems, by Walter Prichard Eaton, dramatic critic, and
author of "The American Stage of Today," "At the New Theater and Others,"
"Idyl of the Twin Fires," etc. The new volume begins with plays produced as
far back as 1910, and brings the record down to the current year. One
section is devoted to American plays, one to foreign plays acted on our
stage, one to various revivals of Shakespeare. These sections form a record
of the important activities of the American theater for the past six years,
and constitute about half of the volume. The remainder of the book is given
over to various discussions of the actor's art, of play construction, of
the new stage craft, of new movements in our theater, such as the
Washington Square Players, and several lighter essays in the satiric vein
which characterized the author's work when he was the dramatic critic of
the <b><i>New York Sun</i></b>. Unlike most volumes of criticisms, this one is
illustrated, the pictures of the productions described in the text
furnishing an additional historical record. At a time when the drama is
regaining its lost position of literary dignity it is particularly fitting
that dignified and intelligent criticism and discussion should also find
accompanying publication.</p>

<p><b><i>Toronto Saturday Night</i></b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. Eaton writes well and with dignity and
independence. His book should find favor with the more
serious students of the Drama of the Day.</p></div>

<p><b><i>Detroit Free Press</i></b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is one of the most interesting and also valuable
books on the modern drama that we have encountered in
that period popularly referred to as "a dog's age." Mr.
Eaton is a competent and well-esteemed critic. The book
is a record of the activities of the American stage
since 1910, down to the present. Mr. Eaton succinctly
restores the play to the memory, revisualizes the
actors, and puts the kernel of it into a nutshell for
us to ponder over and by which to correct our
impressions.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mary MacMillan offers '<span class="smcap">Short Plays</span>,' a collection of
pleasant one to three-act plays for women's clubs,
girls' schools, and home parlor production. Some are
pure comedies, others gentle satires on women's faults
and foibles. 'The Futurists,' a skit on a woman's club
in the year 1882, is highly amusing. 'Entr' Act' is a
charming trifle that brings two quarreling lovers
together through a ridiculous private theatrical. 'The
Ring' carries us gracefully back to the days of
Shakespeare; and 'The Shadowed Star,' the best of the
collection, is a Christmas Eve tragedy. The Star is
shadowed by our thoughtless inhumanity to those who
serve us and our forgetfulness of the needy. The Old
Woman, gone daft, who babbles in a kind of mongrel
Kiltartan, of the Shepherds, the Blessed Babe, of the
Fairies, rowan berries, roses and dancing, while her
daughter dies on Christmas Eve, is a splendid
characterization."</p></div>

<p class="center">BY MARY MacMILLAN</p>

<p>Plays that act well may read well. Miss MacMillan's plays are good reading.
Nor is literary excellence a detriment to dramatic performance. They were
put on the stage before they were put into print. They differ slightly from
those in the former volume. Two of them, "The Pioneers," a story of the
settlement of the Ohio Valley, and "Honey," a little mountain girl
cotton-mill worker, are longer. The other six, "In Mendelesia," Parts I and
II, "The Dryad," "The Dress Rehearsal of Hamlet," "At the Church," and "His
Second Girl," contain the spirit of humor, something of subtlety, and
something of fantasy.</p>

<p><b><i>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</i></b>: "Mary MacMillan, whose first volume of short plays
proved that she possessed unusual gifts as a dramatist, has justified the
hopes of her friends in a second volume, 'More Short Plays,' which reveal
the author as the possessor of a charming literary style coupled with a
sure dramatic sense that never leads her idea astray.... In them all the
reader will find a rich and delicate charm, a bountiful endowment of humor
and wit, a penetrating knowledge of human nature, and a deft touch in the
drawing of character. They are delicately and sympathetically done and
their literary charm is undeniable."</p>

earth are: the adjustment of a man to one woman, a woman to one man, the
children to their parents, the artist to life, the individual to his most
cherished beliefs, and how can we accomplish this adjustment when, try as
we please, there is a destiny which sweeps our little plans away like
helpless chessmen from the board? Since the creation of Anatol, that
delightful toy philosopher, so popular in almost every theater of the
world, the great Physician-Dramatist has pushed on both as World-Dramatist
and reconnoiterer beyond the misty frontiers of man's conscious existence.
He has attempted in an artistic way to get beneath what Freud calls the
"Psychic Censor" which edits all our suppressed desires. Reading Schnitzler
is like going to school to Life itself!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Lucky Pehr</i></p>

<p class="center">By AUGUST STRINDBERG</p>

<p><i>Authorized Translation by Velma Swanston Howard. An allegorical drama in
five acts. Compared favorably to Barrie's "Peter Pan" and Maeterlinck's
"The Blue Bird."</i></p>

<p><b><i>Rochester Post Express</i></b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Strindberg has written many plays which might be
described as realistic nightmares. But this remark does
not apply to "Lucky Pehr." * * * This drama is one of
the most favorable specimens of Strindberg's genius.</p></div>

<p><b><i>New York World</i></b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Pehr" is lucky because, having tested all things, he
finds that only love and duty are true.</p></div>

<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Lucky Pehr" clothes cynicism in real entertainment
instead of in gloom. And it has its surprises. Can this
be August Strindberg, who ends his drama so sweetly on
the note of the woman-soul, leading upward and on?</p></div>

<p><b><i>Worcester Gazette</i></b>:</p>

<p>From a city of Ohio comes this product of Swedish fancy in most attractive
attire, attesting that the possibilities of dramatic art have not entirely
ceased in this age of vaudeville and moving pictures. A great sermon in
altruism is preached in these pages, which we would that millions might see
and hear. To those who think or would like to think, "Lucky Pehr" will
prove a most readable book. * * * An allegory, it is true, but so are
&AElig;sop's Fables, the Parables of the Scriptures and many others of the most
effective lessons ever given.</p>

<p><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A popular drama. * * * There is no doubt about the book
being a delightful companion in the library. In charm
of fancy and grace of imagery the story may not be
unfairly classed with "The Blue Bird" and "Peter Pan."</p></div>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">A Play in Three Acts</span>)</p>

<p class="center">AND STORIES BY AUGUST STRINDBERG</p>

<p><i>Authorized translation by Velma Swanston Howard. In this work the author
reveals a broad tolerance, a rare poetic tenderness augmented by an almost
divine understanding of human frailties as marking certain natural stages
in evolution of the soul.</i></p>

<p><b><i>Louisville Courier-Journal</i></b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Here is a major key of cheerfulness and idealism&mdash;a
relief to a reader who has passed through some of the
author's morbid pages. * * * Some critics find in this
play (Easter) less of the thrust of a distinctive art
than is found in the author's more lugubrious dramas.
There is indeed less sting in it. Nevertheless it has a
nobler tone. It more ably fulfills the purpose of good
drama&mdash;the chastening of the spectators' hearts through
their participation in the suffering of the dramatic
personages. There is in the play a mystical exaltation,
a belief and trust in good and its power to embrace all
in its beneficence, to bring all confusion to harmony.</p></div>

<p><b><i>The Nation</i></b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Those who like the variety of symbolism which
Maeterlinck has often employed&mdash;most notably in the
"Bluebird"&mdash;will turn with pleasure to the short
stories of Strindberg which Mrs. Howard has included in
her volume. * * * They are one and all diverting on
account of the author's facility in dealing with
fanciful details.</p></div>

<p><b><i>Bookseller</i></b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Easter" is a play of six characters illustrative of
human frailties and the effect of the divine power of
tolerance and charity. * * * There is a symbolism, a
poetic quality, a spiritual insight in the author's
work that make a direct appeal to the cultured. * * *</p></div>

<p><b><i>The Dial</i></b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>One play from his (Strindberg's) third, or symbolistic

<p class="center"><i>The Hamlet Problem and Its Solution</i></p>

<p class="center">By EMERSON VENABLE</p>

<p><i>The tragedy of Hamlet has never been adequately interpreted. Two hundred
years of critical discussion has not sufficed to reconcile conflicting
impressions regarding the scope of Shakespeare's design in this, the first
of his great philosophic tragedies. We believe that all those students who
are interested in the study of Shakespeare will find this volume of great
value.</i></p>

<p><b><i>The Louisville Courier-Journal</i></b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mr. Venable's Hamlet is a 'protagonist of a drama of
triumphant moral achievement.' He rises through the
play from an elected agent of vengeance to a man
gravely impressed with 'an imperative sense of moral
obligation, tragic in its depth, felt toward the
world.'"</p></div>

<p><b>E. H. Sothern</b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Your ideas of Hamlet so entirely agree with my own
that the book has been a real delight to me. I have
always had exactly this feeling about the character of
Hamlet. I think you have wiped away a great many
cobwebs, and I believe your book will prove to be most
convincing to many people who may yet be a trifle in
the dark."</p></div>

<p><b><i>The Book News Monthly</i></b>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mr. Venable is the latest critic to apply himself to
the 'Hamlet' problem, and he offers a solution in an
admirably written little book which is sure to attract
readers. Undeterred by the formidable names of Goethe
and Coleridge, Mr. Venable pronounces untenable the
theories which those great authors propounded to
account for the extraordinary figure of the Prince of
Denmark. * * * Mr. Venable looks in another direction
for the solution of the problem. * * * The solution
offered by the author is just the reverse of that
proposed by Goethe. * * * From Mr. Venable's viewpoint
the key to 'Hamlet' is found in the famous soliloquies,
and his book is based upon a close study of those
utterances which bring us within the portals of the
soul of the real Hamlet. The reader with an open mind
will find in Mr. Venable a writer whose breadth of view
and searching thought gives weight to this competent
study of the most interesting of Shakespearean
problems."</p></div>

<p class="center"><i>Portmanteau Plays</i></p>

<p class="center">BY STUART WALKER</p>

<p class="center">Edited and with an Introduction by</p>

<p class="center">EDWARD HALE BIERSTADT</p>

<p>This volume contains four One Act Plays by the inventor and director of the
Portmanteau Theater. They are all included in the regular repertory of the
Theater and the four contained in this volume comprise in themselves an
evening's bill.</p>

<p>There is also an Introduction by Edward Hale Bierstadt on the Portmanteau
Theater in theory and practice.</p>

<p>The book is illustrated by pictures taken from actual presentations of the
plays.</p>

<p>The first play, the "<b><i>Trimplet</i></b>," deals with the search for a certain magic
thing called a trimplet which can cure all the ills of whoever finds it.
The search and the finding constitute the action of the piece.</p>

<p>Second play, "<b><i>Six who Pass While the Lentils Boil</i></b>" is perhaps the most
popular in Mr. Walker's repertory. The story is of a Queen who, having
stepped on the ring-toe of the King's great-aunt, is condemned to die
before the clock strikes twelve. The Six who pass the pot in which boil the
lentils are on their way to the execution.</p>

<p>Next comes "<b><i>Nevertheless</i></b>," which tells of a burglar who oddly enough
reaches regeneration through two children and a dictionary.</p>

<p>And last of all is the "<b><i>Medicine-Show</i></b>," which is a character study
situated on the banks of the Mississippi. One does not see either the Show
or the Mississippi, but the characters are so all sufficient that one does
not miss the others.</p>

<p>All of these plays are fanciful&mdash;symbolic if you like&mdash;but all of them have
a very distinct raison d'&ecirc;tre in themselves, quite apart from any ulterior
meaning.</p>

<p>With Mr. Walker it is always "the story first," and herein he is at one
with Lord Dunsany and others of his ilk. The plays have body, force, and
beauty always; and if the reader desires to read in anything else surely
that is his privilege.</p>

<p>Each play, and even the Theater itself has a prologue, and with the help of
these one is enabled to pass from one charming tale to the next without a
break in the continuity.</p>

<p><i>With five full-page illustrations on cameo paper.</i></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="center"><i>The Truth About The Theater</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Anonymous</i></p>

<p>Precisely what the title indicates&mdash;facts as they are, plain and
unmistakable without veneer of any sort. It goes directly to the heart of
the whole matter. Behind the writer of it&mdash;who is one of the best known
theatrical men in New York&mdash;are long years of experience. He recites what
he knows, what he has seen, and his quiet, calm, authoritative account of
conditions as they are is without adornment, excuse or exaggeration. It is
intended to be helpful to those who want the facts, and for them it will
prove of immeasurable value.</p>

<p>"The Truth About the Theater," in brief, lifts the curtain on the American
stage. It leaves no phase of the subject untouched. To those who are
ambitious to serve the theater, either as players or as playwrights, or,
again, in some managerial capacity, the book is invaluable. To those, too,
who would know more about the theater that they may come to some fair
estimate of the worth of the innumerable theories nowadays advanced, the
book will again prove its value.</p>

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
